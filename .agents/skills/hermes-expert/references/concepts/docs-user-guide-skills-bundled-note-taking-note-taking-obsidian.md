info

The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.

# Obsidian Vault

Use this skill for filesystem-first Obsidian vault work: reading notes, listing notes, searching note files, creating notes, appending content, and adding wikilinks.

## Vault path[​](#vault-path "Direct link to Vault path")

Use a known or resolved vault path before calling file tools.

The documented vault-path convention is the `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` environment variable, for example from `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/.env`. If it is unset, use `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault`.

File tools do not expand shell variables. Do not pass paths containing `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` to `read_file`, `write_file`, `patch`, or `search_files`; resolve the vault path first and pass a concrete absolute path. Vault paths may contain spaces, which is another reason to prefer file tools over shell commands.

If the vault path is unknown, `terminal` is acceptable for resolving `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` or checking whether the fallback path exists. Once the path is known, switch back to file tools.

## Read a note[​](#read-a-note "Direct link to Read a note")

Use `read_file` with the resolved absolute path to the note. Prefer this over `cat` because it provides line numbers and pagination.

## List notes[​](#list-notes "Direct link to List notes")

Use `search_files` with `target: "files"` and the resolved vault path. Prefer this over `find` or `ls`.

* To list all markdown notes, use `pattern: "*.md"` under the vault path.
* To list a subfolder, search under that subfolder's absolute path.

## Search[​](#search "Direct link to Search")

Use `search_files` for both filename and content searches. Prefer this over `grep`, `find`, or `ls`.

* For filenames, use `search_files` with `target: "files"` and a filename `pattern`.
* For note contents, use `search_files` with `target: "content"`, the content regex as `pattern`, and `file_glob: "*.md"` when you want to restrict matches to markdown notes.

## Create a note[​](#create-a-note "Direct link to Create a note")

Use `write_file` with the resolved absolute path and the full markdown content. Prefer this over shell heredocs or `echo` because it avoids shell quoting issues and returns structured results.

## Append to a note[​](#append-to-a-note "Direct link to Append to a note")

Prefer a native file-tool workflow when it is not awkward:

* Read the target note with `read_file`.
* Use `patch` for an anchored append when there is stable context, such as adding a section after an existing heading or appending before a known trailing block.
* Use `write_file` when rewriting the whole note is clearer than constructing a fragile patch.

For an anchored append with `patch`, replace the anchor with the anchor plus the new content.

For a simple append with no stable context, `terminal` is acceptable if it is the clearest safe option.

## Targeted edits[​](#targeted-edits "Direct link to Targeted edits")

Use `patch` for focused note changes when the current content gives you stable context. Prefer this over shell text rewriting.

## Wikilinks[​](#wikilinks "Direct link to Wikilinks")

Obsidian links notes with `[[Note Name]]` syntax. When creating notes, use these to link related content.

Type `@` followed by a reference to inject content directly into your message. Hermes expands the reference inline and appends the content under an `--- Attached Context ---` section.

## Supported References[​](#supported-references "Direct link to Supported References")

| Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@file:path/to/file.py` | Inject file contents |
| `@file:path/to/file.py:10-25` | Inject specific line range (1-indexed, inclusive) |
| `@folder:path/to/dir` | Inject directory tree listing with file metadata |
| `@diff` | Inject `git diff` (unstaged working tree changes) |
| `@staged` | Inject `git diff --staged` (staged changes) |
| `@git:5` | Inject last N commits with patches (max 10) |
| `@url:https://example.com` | Fetch and inject web page content |

## Usage Examples[​](#usage-examples "Direct link to Usage Examples")

```
Review @file:src/main.py and suggest improvements  
  
What changed? @diff  
  
Compare @file:old_config.yaml and @file:new_config.yaml  
  
What's in @folder:src/components?  
  
Summarize this article @url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00001
```

Multiple references work in a single message:

```
Check @file:main.py, and also @file:test.py.
```

Trailing punctuation (`,`, `.`, `;`, `!`, `?`) is automatically stripped from reference values.

## CLI Tab Completion[​](#cli-tab-completion "Direct link to CLI Tab Completion")

In the interactive CLI, typing `@` triggers autocomplete:

* `@` shows all reference types (`@diff`, `@staged`, `@file:`, `@folder:`, `@git:`, `@url:`)
* `@file:` and `@folder:` trigger filesystem path completion with file size metadata
* Bare `@` followed by partial text shows matching files and folders from the current directory

## Line Ranges[​](#line-ranges "Direct link to Line Ranges")

The `@file:` reference supports line ranges for precise content injection:

```
@file:src/main.py:42        # Single line 42  
@file:src/main.py:10-25     # Lines 10 through 25 (inclusive)
```

Lines are 1-indexed. Invalid ranges are silently ignored (full file is returned).

## Size Limits[​](#size-limits "Direct link to Size Limits")

Context references are bounded to prevent overwhelming the model's context window:

| Threshold | Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Soft limit | 25% of context length | Warning appended, expansion proceeds |
| Hard limit | 50% of context length | Expansion refused, original message returned unchanged |
| Folder entries | 200 files max | Excess entries replaced with `- ...` |
| Git commits | 10 max | `@git:N` clamped to range [1, 10] |

## Security[​](#security "Direct link to Security")

### Sensitive Path Blocking[​](#sensitive-path-blocking "Direct link to Sensitive Path Blocking")

These paths are always blocked from `@file:` references to prevent credential exposure:

* SSH keys and config: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, `~/.ssh/config`
* Shell profiles: `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zprofile`
* Credential files: `~/.netrc`, `~/.pgpass`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.pypirc`
* Hermes env: `$HERMES_HOME/.env`

These directories are fully blocked (any file inside):

* `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`, `~/.gnupg/`, `~/.kube/`, `$HERMES_HOME/skills/.hub/`

### Path Traversal Protection[​](#path-traversal-protection "Direct link to Path Traversal Protection")

All paths are resolved relative to the working directory. References that resolve outside the allowed workspace root are rejected.

### Binary File Detection[​](#binary-file-detection "Direct link to Binary File Detection")

Binary files are detected via MIME type and null-byte scanning. Known text extensions (`.py`, `.md`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.js`, `.ts`, etc.) bypass MIME-based detection. Binary files are rejected with a warning.

## Platform Availability[​](#platform-availability "Direct link to Platform Availability")

Context references are primarily a **CLI feature**. They work in the interactive CLI where `@` triggers tab completion and references are expanded before the message is sent to the agent.

In **messaging platforms** (Telegram, Discord, etc.), the `@` syntax is not expanded by the gateway — messages are passed through as-is. The agent itself can still reference files via the `read_file`, `search_files`, and `web_extract` tools.

## Interaction with Context Compression[​](#interaction-with-context-compression "Direct link to Interaction with Context Compression")

When conversation context is compressed, the expanded reference content is included in the compression summary. This means:

* Large file contents injected via `@file:` contribute to context usage
* If the conversation is later compressed, the file content is summarized (not preserved verbatim)
* For very large files, consider using line ranges (`@file:main.py:100-200`) to inject only relevant sections

## Common Patterns[​](#common-patterns "Direct link to Common Patterns")

```
# Code review workflow  
Review @diff and check for security issues  
  
# Debug with context  
This test is failing. Here's the test @file:tests/test_auth.py  
and the implementation @file:src/auth.py:50-80  
  
# Project exploration  
What does this project do? @folder:src @file:README.md  
  
# Research  
Compare the approaches in @url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00001  
and @url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00002
```

## Error Handling[​](#error-handling "Direct link to Error Handling")

Invalid references produce inline warnings rather than failures:

| Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| File not found | Warning: "file not found" |
| Binary file | Warning: "binary files are not supported" |
| Folder not found | Warning: "folder not found" |
| Git command fails | Warning with git stderr |
| URL returns no content | Warning: "no content extracted" |
| Sensitive path | Warning: "path is a sensitive credential file" |
| Path outside workspace | Warning: "path is outside the allowed workspace" |

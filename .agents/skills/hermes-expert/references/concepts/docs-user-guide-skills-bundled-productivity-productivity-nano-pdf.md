## Notes[​](#notes "Direct link to Notes")

* Page numbers may be 0-based or 1-based depending on version — if the edit hits the wrong page, retry with ±1
* Always verify the output PDF after editing (use `read_file` to check file size, or open it)
* The tool uses an LLM under the hood — requires an API key (check `nano-pdf --help` for config)
* Works well for text changes; complex layout modifications may need a different approach

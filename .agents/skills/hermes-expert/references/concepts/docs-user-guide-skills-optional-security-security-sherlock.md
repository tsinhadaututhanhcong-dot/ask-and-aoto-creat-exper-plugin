# Sherlock OSINT Username Search

Hunt down social media accounts by username across 400+ social networks using the [Sherlock Project](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock).

## When to Use[​](#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")

* User asks to find accounts associated with a username
* User wants to check username availability across platforms
* User is conducting OSINT or reconnaissance research
* User asks "where is this username registered?" or similar

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")

* Sherlock CLI installed: `pipx install sherlock-project` or `pip install sherlock-project`
* Alternatively: Docker available (`docker run -it --rm sherlock/sherlock`)
* Network access to query social platforms

## Procedure[​](#procedure "Direct link to Procedure")

### 1. Check if Sherlock is Installed[​](#1-check-if-sherlock-is-installed "Direct link to 1. Check if Sherlock is Installed")

**Before doing anything else**, verify sherlock is available:

```
sherlock --version
```

If the command fails:

* Offer to install: `pipx install sherlock-project` (recommended) or `pip install sherlock-project`
* **Do NOT** try multiple installation methods — pick one and proceed
* If installation fails, inform the user and stop

### 2. Extract Username[​](#2-extract-username "Direct link to 2. Extract Username")

**Extract the username directly from the user's message if clearly stated.**

Examples where you should **NOT** use clarify:

* "Find accounts for nasa" → username is `nasa`
* "Search for johndoe123" → username is `johndoe123`
* "Check if alice exists on social media" → username is `alice`
* "Look up user bob on social networks" → username is `bob`

**Only use clarify if:**

* Multiple potential usernames mentioned ("search for alice or bob")
* Ambiguous phrasing ("search for my username" without specifying)
* No username mentioned at all ("do an OSINT search")

When extracting, take the **exact** username as stated — preserve case, numbers, underscores, etc.

### 3. Build Command[​](#3-build-command "Direct link to 3. Build Command")

**Default command** (use this unless user specifically requests otherwise):

```
sherlock --print-found --no-color "<username>" --timeout 90
```

**Optional flags** (only add if user explicitly requests):

* `--nsfw` — Include NSFW sites (only if user asks)
* `--tor` — Route through Tor (only if user asks for anonymity)

**Do NOT ask about options via clarify** — just run the default search. Users can request specific options if needed.

### 4. Execute Search[​](#4-execute-search "Direct link to 4. Execute Search")

Run via the `terminal` tool. The command typically takes 30-120 seconds depending on network conditions and site count.

**Example terminal call:**

```
{  
  "command": "sherlock --print-found --no-color \"target_username\"",  
  "timeout": 180  
}
```

### 5. Parse and Present Results[​](#5-parse-and-present-results "Direct link to 5. Parse and Present Results")

Sherlock outputs found accounts in a simple format. Parse the output and present:

1. **Summary line:** "Found X accounts for username 'Y'"
2. **Categorized links:** Group by platform type if helpful (social, professional, forums, etc.)
3. **Output file location:** Sherlock saves results to `<username>.txt` by default

**Example output parsing:**

```
[+] Instagram: https://instagram.com/username  
[+] Twitter: https://twitter.com/username  
[+] GitHub: https://github.com/username
```

Present findings as clickable links when possible.

## Pitfalls[​](#pitfalls "Direct link to Pitfalls")

### No Results Found[​](#no-results-found "Direct link to No Results Found")

If Sherlock finds no accounts, this is often correct — the username may not be registered on checked platforms. Suggest:

* Checking spelling/variation
* Trying similar usernames with `?` wildcard: `sherlock "user?name"`
* The user may have privacy settings or deleted accounts

### Timeout Issues[​](#timeout-issues "Direct link to Timeout Issues")

Some sites are slow or block automated requests. Use `--timeout 120` to increase wait time, or `--site` to limit scope.

### Tor Configuration[​](#tor-configuration "Direct link to Tor Configuration")

`--tor` requires Tor daemon running. If user wants anonymity but Tor isn't available, suggest:

* Installing Tor service
* Using `--proxy` with an alternative proxy

### False Positives[​](#false-positives "Direct link to False Positives")

Some sites always return "found" due to their response structure. Cross-reference unexpected results with manual checks.

### Rate Limiting[​](#rate-limiting "Direct link to Rate Limiting")

Aggressive searches may trigger rate limits. For bulk username searches, add delays between calls or use `--local` with cached data.

## Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

### pipx (recommended)[​](#pipx-recommended "Direct link to pipx (recommended)")

```
pipx install sherlock-project
```

### pip[​](#pip "Direct link to pip")

```
pip install sherlock-project
```

### Docker[​](#docker "Direct link to Docker")

```
docker pull sherlock/sherlock  
docker run -it --rm sherlock/sherlock <username>
```

### Linux packages[​](#linux-packages "Direct link to Linux packages")

Available on Debian 13+, Ubuntu 22.10+, Homebrew, Kali, BlackArch.

## Ethical Use[​](#ethical-use "Direct link to Ethical Use")

This tool is for legitimate OSINT and research purposes only. Remind users:

* Only search usernames they own or have permission to investigate
* Respect platform terms of service
* Do not use for harassment, stalking, or illegal activities
* Consider privacy implications before sharing results

## Verification[​](#verification "Direct link to Verification")

After running sherlock, verify:

1. Output lists found sites with URLs
2. `<username>.txt` file created (default output) if using file output
3. If `--print-found` used, output should only contain `[+]` lines for matches

## Example Interaction[​](#example-interaction "Direct link to Example Interaction")

**User:** "Can you check if the username 'johndoe123' exists on social media?"

**Agent procedure:**

1. Check `sherlock --version` (verify installed)
2. Username provided — proceed directly
3. Run: `sherlock --print-found --no-color "johndoe123" --timeout 90`
4. Parse output and present links

**Response format:**

> Found 12 accounts for username 'johndoe123':
>
> • <https://twitter.com/johndoe123>
> • <https://github.com/johndoe123>
> • <https://instagram.com/johndoe123>
> • [... additional links]
>
> Results saved to: johndoe123.txt

---

**User:** "Search for username 'alice' including NSFW sites"

**Agent procedure:**

1. Check sherlock installed
2. Username + NSFW flag both provided
3. Run: `sherlock --print-found --no-color --nsfw "alice" --timeout 90`
4. Present results

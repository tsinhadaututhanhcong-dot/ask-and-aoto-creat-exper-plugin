# AFTER (claude-agent-sdk)
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(model="claude-opus-4-7", permission_mode="acceptEdits")
```

**Why this changed:** The type name now matches the “Claude Agent SDK” branding and provides consistency across the SDK’s naming conventions.

### [​](#system-prompt-no-longer-default) System prompt no longer default

**What changed:** The SDK no longer uses Claude Code’s system prompt by default.
**Migration:**

TypeScript

Python

```
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

// BEFORE (v0.0.x) - Used Claude Code's system prompt by default
const before = query({ prompt: "Hello" });

// AFTER (v0.1.0) - Uses minimal system prompt by default
// To get the old behavior, explicitly request Claude Code's preset:
const presetResult = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    systemPrompt: { type: "preset", preset: "claude_code" }
  }
});

// Or use a custom system prompt:
const customResult = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful coding assistant"
  }
});
```

**Why this changed:** Provides better control and isolation for SDK applications. You can now build agents with custom behavior without inheriting Claude Code’s CLI-focused instructions.

### [​](#settings-sources-default) Settings sources default

This default was briefly changed in v0.1.0 and then reverted, so no migration action is needed.
**Current behavior:** Omitting `settingSources` on `query()` loads user, project, and local filesystem settings, matching the CLI. This includes `~/.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, CLAUDE.md files, and custom commands.
To run isolated from filesystem settings, pass an empty array:

TypeScript

Python

```
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const isolatedResult = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    settingSources: [] // No filesystem settings loaded
  }
});

// Or load only specific sources:
const projectOnlyResult = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    settingSources: ["project"] // Only project settings
  }
});
```

Isolation is especially important for CI/CD pipelines, deployed applications, test environments, and multi-tenant systems where local customizations should not leak in.

SDK v0.1.0 briefly defaulted to no settings loaded; this was reverted in subsequent releases. Python SDK 0.1.59 and earlier treated an empty list the same as omitting the option, so upgrade before relying on `setting_sources=[]`. See [What settingSources does not control](/docs/en/agent-sdk/claude-code-features#what-settingsources-does-not-control) for inputs that are read even when `settingSources` is `[]`.

## [​](#why-the-rename) Why the Rename?

The Claude Code SDK was originally designed for coding tasks, but it has evolved into a powerful framework for building all types of AI agents. The new name “Claude Agent SDK” better reflects its capabilities:

* Building business agents (legal assistants, finance advisors, customer support)
* Creating specialized coding agents (SRE bots, security reviewers, code review agents)
* Developing custom agents for any domain with tool use, MCP integration, and more

## [​](#getting-help) Getting Help

If you encounter any issues during migration:
**For TypeScript/JavaScript:**

1. Check that all imports are updated to use `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
2. Verify your package.json has the new package name
3. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are updated

**For Python:**

1. Check that all imports are updated to use `claude_agent_sdk`
2. Verify your requirements.txt or pyproject.toml has the new package name
3. Run `pip install claude-agent-sdk` to ensure the package is installed

Week 26

v2.1.185–v2.1.193

**`claude mcp login`**: authenticate a configured MCP server from your shell instead of the interactive `/mcp` menu, and clear its stored credentials later with `claude mcp logout`.Also this week: **shell mode responds to command output** (`! npm test` gets an explanation without a second prompt); **`/rewind`** can resume a conversation from before `/clear` was run; and **background subagents** now surface permission prompts in the main session instead of auto-denying.[Read the Week 26 digest →](/docs/en/whats-new/2026-w26)

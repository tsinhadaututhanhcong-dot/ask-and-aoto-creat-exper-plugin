Claude Opus 4.8new model

Opus 4.8 is now the default on Max, Team Premium, Enterprise pay-as-you-go, and the Anthropic API. It defaults to high effort; use `/effort xhigh` for harder tasks. Requires v2.1.154 or later.

> /model claude-opus-4-8
```

Dynamic workflowsresearch preview

A workflow is an orchestration script Claude writes for your task and runs across many subagents in the background. Use one when a task is too large for one conversation to coordinate: a codebase-wide audit, a large migration, a research question that needs cross-checking. Manage runs with `/workflows`.

Describe the task and ask for a workflow:

Claude Code

```
> create a workflow that migrates every internal fetch() call to the new HttpClient wrapper
```

Security guidance pluginplugin

The security-guidance plugin reviews Claude’s code changes for vulnerabilities and fixes them in the same session. It runs a fast pattern check on each edit, a model review at the end of each turn, and a deeper agentic review on commit or push. Add project rules in `.claude/claude-security-guidance.md`.

Install it from the official Anthropic marketplace:

Claude Code

```
> /plugin install security-guidance@claude-plugins-official
```

Then activate it in the current session:

Claude Code

```
> /reload-plugins
```

Fast mode on Opus 4.8research preview

Fast mode now defaults to Opus 4.8 at $10/$50 per MTok: 2x the standard rate for about 2.5x the speed. Opus 4.7 and 4.6 stay at $30/$150. Opus 4.6 fast mode is deprecated.

Toggle fast mode, now on Opus 4.8:

Claude Code

```
> /fast
```

Other wins

In `claude agents`, prefix a shell command with `!` to run it as a background job you can attach to and detach from; also available as `claude —bg —exec ‘pytest -x’`

Plugins in `.claude/skills` directories are now loaded automatically, no marketplace required, and `claude plugin init <name>` scaffolds a new plugin

New `/reload-skills` command re-scans skill directories without restarting, and `SessionStart` hooks can return `reloadSkills: true` to make skills they install available in the same session

Skills and commands can set `disallowed-tools` in frontmatter to remove tools from the model while the skill is active

New `MessageDisplay` hook event lets hooks transform or hide assistant message text as it is displayed

Claude Code now switches to your configured `—fallback-model` for the rest of the session when the primary model is not found, instead of failing every request

Plugins can declare `defaultEnabled: false` in `plugin.json` or a marketplace entry, so they install without turning on until you enable them

Vim mode: `/` in NORMAL mode opens reverse history search, matching Bash and Zsh vi-mode

Streaming tool execution is now always enabled, including with telemetry disabled and on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry

`←←` to open the agents view now works on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, and with telemetry disabled

Claude in Chrome: pick which connected browser to use via `/chrome` → “Select browser…”, or in-chat when a browser action runs with multiple connected

`claude mcp list` and `claude mcp get` now show unapproved `.mcp.json` servers as pending approval instead of auto-approving and connecting when output is piped

/ultrareviewresearch preview

Now in public research preview. Ultrareview runs a fleet of bug-hunting agents in the cloud against your branch or a PR, and findings land back in the CLI or Desktop automatically. Run it before merging critical changes such as auth or data migrations.

Review the branch you’re on:

Claude Code

```
> /ultrareview
```

Or point it at a PR:

Claude Code

```
> /ultrareview 1234
```

Session recapCLI

Switch focus away from a session and come back to a one-line recap of what happened while you were gone. Helpful for staying in flow while running several Claude sessions at once.

Generate a recap on demand, or turn the automatic one off from `/config`:

Claude Code

```
> /recap
```

Custom themesv2.1.118

Build and switch between named color themes from `/theme`, or hand-edit JSON files in `~/.claude/themes/`. Each theme picks a base preset and overrides only the tokens you care about. Plugins can ship themes too.

Open the theme picker and create a new one:

Claude Code

```
> /theme
```

Claude Code on the webweb

A new look for [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) that matches the redesigned desktop app: sessions sidebar, drag-and-drop layout, and a refreshed routines view. Key parts were rebuilt for quicker responses and a more reliable experience.

Other wins

[Vim visual mode](/docs/en/interactive-mode#vim-editor-mode): press `v` for character selection or `V` for line selection in the prompt input, with operators and visual feedback

Hooks can now call MCP tools directly via [`type: “mcp_tool”`](/docs/en/hooks#mcp-tool-hook-fields), so a hook can hit an already-connected server without spawning a process

`/cost` and `/stats` are merged into [`/usage`](/docs/en/commands); the old names still work as typing shortcuts that open the relevant tab

`/config` changes (theme, editor mode, verbose, and similar) now persist to `~/.claude/settings.json` and follow the same project/local/policy precedence as other [settings](/docs/en/settings)

[Forked subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents#fork-the-current-conversation) can be enabled on external builds with `CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=1`: a fork inherits your full conversation context instead of starting fresh

Default [effort level](/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) for Pro and Max subscribers on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 is now `high` (was `medium`)

Native macOS and Linux builds replace the `Glob` and `Grep` tools with embedded `bfs` and `ugrep` available through Bash, for faster searches without a separate tool round-trip

`—from-pr` now accepts GitLab merge request, Bitbucket pull request, and GitHub Enterprise PR URLs in addition to github.com

Auto mode: include `“$defaults”` in [`autoMode.allow`, `soft_deny`, or `environment`](/docs/en/auto-mode-config) to add custom rules alongside the built-in list instead of replacing it

New [`claude plugin tag`](/docs/en/plugin-dependencies#tag-plugin-releases-for-version-resolution) command creates release git tags for plugins with version validation

Opus 4.7 sessions now compute against the model’s native 1M context window, fixing inflated `/context` percentages and premature autocompaction

`/resume` on large sessions is up to 67% faster and now offers to summarize stale, large sessions before re-reading them

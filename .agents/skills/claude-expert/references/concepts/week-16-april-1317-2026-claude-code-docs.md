Releases [v2.1.105 → v2.1.113](/docs/en/changelog#2-1-105)5 features · April 13–17

Claude Opus 4.7new model

Anthropic’s strongest coding model yet is now the default on Max and Team Premium, and available everywhere else from `/model`. It adds a new `xhigh` effort level that sits between `high` and `max`: best results for most coding and agentic tasks, applied as the default the first time you switch to 4.7. `/effort` now opens an interactive arrow-key slider when you call it without arguments, so you can dial intelligence against speed without remembering the level names.

Switch model and effort in one go:

Claude Code

```
> /model opus
> /effort xhigh
```

Routinesweb

Templated cloud agents that fire on a schedule, a GitHub event, or an API call. Define a routine once on Claude Code on the web with a prompt, the repos it can touch, and the connectors it needs, then let PR-opened, release-published, or your own webhook trigger it without your machine running. The trigger picker now covers GitHub events with optional filters and gives every routine a tokened `/fire` endpoint for external systems.

Create one from the web UI, or scaffold from your terminal:

Claude Code

```
> /schedule daily PR review at 9am
```

/usage breakdownCLI

More visibility into where your Claude Code usage goes. `/usage` now shows what’s driving your limits: parallel sessions, subagents, cache misses, and long context, each with a percentage of your last 24 hours and a tip to optimize it. Press `d` or `w` to switch between day and week views.

![The /usage command showing a breakdown of what's contributing to limits usage](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/FTi4SBJ9YRs7d-5X/images/whats-new/usage.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=FTi4SBJ9YRs7d-5X&q=85&s=792a4b43cbef4e2931974831f076bca6)

Run it any time:

Claude Code

```
> /usage
```

Mobile push notificationsmobile

With [Remote Control](/docs/en/remote-control) connected, Claude can send a push notification to your phone when a long task finishes or it needs a decision to keep going. Turn it on with “Push when Claude decides” in `/config`, or ask for one in your prompt. Useful when you kick off a long agent run and want to step away from the terminal.

[](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/uII1TETOZxBUZ3lB/images/whats-new/push-notifications.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=uII1TETOZxBUZ3lB&q=85&s=c91a967139596500cbdb581a53822ac1)

Ask Claude to ping you when it’s done:

Claude Code

```
> notify me when the tests pass
```

Native binariesv2.1.113

The `claude` CLI now spawns a native per-platform binary instead of bundled JavaScript, so the installed `claude` command no longer invokes Node. The npm package pulls the right binary in through an optional dependency such as `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-darwin-arm64`, so your install command doesn’t change. The standalone installer already shipped this binary; npm now matches it.

Upgrade and check what you’re running:

```
claude update
claude --version
```

Other wins

New [`/ultrareview`](/docs/en/ultrareview): comprehensive code review in the cloud using parallel multi-agent analysis and an adversarial critique pass. Run it bare to review your current branch, or `/ultrareview <PR#>` for a specific PR

[Auto mode](/docs/en/permission-modes#eliminate-prompts-with-auto-mode) is now available for Max subscribers on Opus 4.7, and the `—enable-auto-mode` flag is no longer required

[Session recap](/docs/en/interactive-mode#session-recap) shows a one-line summary of what happened while you were away; run `/recap` on demand or turn it off from `/config`

New `/tui` command and `tui` setting switch between classic and flicker-free rendering mid-conversation; focus view moved from `Ctrl+O` to its own `/focus` command

Plugins can ship background watchers via a top-level `monitors` manifest key that auto-arms at session start or on skill invoke

”Auto (match terminal)” option in `/theme` follows your terminal’s dark/light mode

`/fewer-permission-prompts` scans your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP calls and proposes an allowlist for `.claude/settings.json`

Claude can now discover and run built-in commands like `/init`, `/review`, and `/security-review` via the Skill tool

`PreCompact` hooks can block compaction by exiting with code 2 or returning `“decision”:“block”`

`ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` opts API key, Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry users into 1-hour prompt cache TTL

`sandbox.network.deniedDomains` setting carves specific domains out of a broader `allowedDomains` wildcard

`/undo` is now an alias for `/rewind`, and `/proactive` is an alias for `/loop`

Hardened Bash permissions: deny rules now match through `env`/`sudo`/`watch` wrappers, and `Bash(find:*)` allow rules no longer auto-approve `-exec` or `-delete`

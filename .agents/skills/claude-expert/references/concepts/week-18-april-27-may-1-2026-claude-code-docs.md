# Week 18 · April 27 – May 1, 2026 - Claude Code Docs
**Source:** [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new/2026-w18](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new/2026-w18)

Releases [v2.1.120 → v2.1.126](/docs/en/changelog#2-1-120)4 features · April 27 – May 1

Sign in without a browser callbackv2.1.126

`claude auth login` now accepts the OAuth code pasted directly into the terminal when the browser callback can’t reach localhost. That covers WSL2, SSH sessions, and containers, where the redirect to a local port doesn’t work. The same release also fixes login timeouts on slow or proxied connections and in IPv6-only devcontainers.

Sign in, then paste the code from the browser:

```
claude auth login
```

[CLI reference](/docs/en/cli-reference#cli-commands)

claude project purgev2.1.124

Delete all Claude Code state for a project: transcripts, tasks, file history, and the project’s config entry. Supports `--dry-run` to preview, `-y`/`--yes` to skip confirmation, `-i`/`--interactive` to choose, and `--all` to clear every project.

Preview what would be removed:

```
claude project purge --dry-run
```

Then run it for real:

```
claude project purge
```

Resume by PR URLv2.1.122

When you create a pull request with `gh pr create`, Claude Code links it to the session that produced it. Now you can get back to that session from the PR URL alone, without remembering its name.

Open the session picker:

Claude Code

```
> /resume
```

Paste the PR URL into the picker. The first character of the paste drops you into search mode, and the list filters to the session that created that PR. Press Enter to resume it. GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, and Bitbucket pull and merge request URLs all work.

Claude Code

```
https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/1234
```

To skip the picker, pass the PR number on the command line instead:

```
claude --from-pr 1234
```

[Sessions: use the session picker](/docs/en/sessions#use-the-session-picker)

Windows without Git BashWindows

Git for Windows is no longer required. When Bash is absent, Claude Code uses PowerShell as the shell tool, and when the PowerShell tool is enabled it is treated as the primary shell. PowerShell 7 installed via the Microsoft Store, MSI without PATH, or a `.NET` global tool is now detected automatically.

Other wins

MCP servers can opt out of tool-search deferral with `alwaysLoad: true` in their config so all of that server’s tools are always available

New `claude plugin prune` removes orphaned auto-installed plugin dependencies, and `plugin uninstall —prune` cascades

`/skills` now has a type-to-filter search box so you can find a skill in a long list without scrolling

`PostToolUse` hooks can replace tool output for any tool via `hookSpecificOutput.updatedToolOutput`, not only MCP tools

New [`claude ultrareview`](/docs/en/ultrareview) subcommand runs `/ultrareview` non-interactively from CI or scripts: prints findings to stdout (`—json` for raw output) and exits 0 on completion or 1 on failure

`—dangerously-skip-permissions` now bypasses prompts for writes to `.claude/`, `.git/`, `.vscode/`, shell config files, and other previously protected paths, while catastrophic removal commands still prompt as a safety net

The `/model` picker can list models from your gateway’s `/v1/models` endpoint when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at an Anthropic-compatible gateway; opt in with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` since v2.1.129

MCP servers that hit a transient error during startup now auto-retry up to 3 times instead of staying disconnected

`ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER` selects a Bedrock service tier: `default`, `flex`, or `priority`

`/terminal-setup` enables iTerm2’s clipboard access setting so `/copy` works, including from tmux

Vertex AI now supports X.509 certificate-based Workload Identity Federation (mTLS ADC)

Significant memory leak fixes: image-heavy sessions, `/usage` on large transcript histories, and long-running tools without progress events

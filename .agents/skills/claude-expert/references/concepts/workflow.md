# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when you're done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
```

CLAUDE.md is loaded every session, so only include things that apply broadly. For domain knowledge or workflows that are only relevant sometimes, use [skills](/docs/en/skills) instead. Claude loads them on demand without bloating every conversation.
Keep it concise. For each line, ask: *“Would removing this cause Claude to make mistakes?”* If not, cut it. Bloated CLAUDE.md files cause Claude to ignore your actual instructions!

| ✅ Include | ❌ Exclude |
| --- | --- |
| Bash commands Claude can’t guess | Anything Claude can figure out by reading code |
| Code style rules that differ from defaults | Standard language conventions Claude already knows |
| Testing instructions and preferred test runners | Detailed API documentation (link to docs instead) |
| Repository etiquette (branch naming, PR conventions) | Information that changes frequently |
| Architectural decisions specific to your project | Long explanations or tutorials |
| Developer environment quirks (required env vars) | File-by-file descriptions of the codebase |
| Common gotchas or non-obvious behaviors | Self-evident practices like “write clean code” |

If Claude keeps doing something you don’t want despite having a rule against it, the file is probably too long and the rule is getting lost. If Claude asks you questions that are answered in CLAUDE.md, the phrasing might be ambiguous. Treat CLAUDE.md like code: review it when things go wrong, prune it regularly, and test changes by observing whether Claude’s behavior actually shifts.
You can tune instructions by adding emphasis (e.g., “IMPORTANT” or “YOU MUST”) to improve adherence. Check CLAUDE.md into git so your team can contribute. The file compounds in value over time.
CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax:

CLAUDE.md

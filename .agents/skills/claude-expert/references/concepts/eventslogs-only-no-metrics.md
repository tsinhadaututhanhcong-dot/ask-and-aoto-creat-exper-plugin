## [​](#available-metrics-and-events) Available metrics and events

### [​](#standard-attributes) Standard attributes

All metrics and events share these standard attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Controlled By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session.id` | Unique session identifier | `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID` (default: true) |
| `app.version` | Current Claude Code version | `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_VERSION` (default: false) |
| `app.entrypoint` | How the session was launched, such as `cli`, `sdk-cli`, `sdk-ts`, `sdk-py`, or `claude-vscode` | `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_ENTRYPOINT` (default: false) |
| `organization.id` | Organization UUID (when authenticated) | Always included when available |
| `user.account_uuid` | Account UUID (when authenticated) | `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_ACCOUNT_UUID` (default: true) |
| `user.account_id` | Account ID in tagged format matching Anthropic admin APIs (when authenticated), such as `user_01BWBeN28...` | `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_ACCOUNT_UUID` (default: true) |
| `user.id` | Random anonymous identifier generated on first run and persisted in `~/.claude.json`. It contains no personal information and is not derived from your Claude account. Deleting the file produces a new unrelated value on next run. | Always included |

Events additionally include the following attributes. These are never attached to metrics because they would cause unbounded cardinality:

* `prompt.id`: UUID correlating a user prompt with all subsequent events until the next prompt. See [Event correlation attributes](#event-correlation-attributes).
* `workspace.host_paths`: host workspace directories selected in the desktop app, as a string array

### [​](#events) Events

Claude Code exports the following events via OpenTelemetry logs/events (when `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` is configured):

#### [​](#event-correlation-attributes) Event correlation attributes

When a user submits a prompt, Claude Code may make multiple API calls and run several tools. The `prompt.id` attribute lets you tie all of those events back to the single prompt that triggered them.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `prompt.id` | UUID v4 identifier linking all events produced while processing a single user prompt |

To trace all activity triggered by a single prompt, filter your events by a specific `prompt.id` value. This returns the user\_prompt event, any api\_request events, and any tool\_result events that occurred while processing that prompt.

`prompt.id` is intentionally excluded from metrics because each prompt generates a unique ID, which would create an ever-growing number of time series. Use it for event-level analysis and audit trails only.

#### [​](#user-prompt-event) User prompt event

Logged when a user submits a prompt.
**Event Name**: `claude_code.user_prompt`
**Attributes**:

* All [standard attributes](#standard-attributes)
* `event.name`: `"user_prompt"`
* `event.timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
* `event.sequence`: monotonically increasing counter for ordering events within a session
* `prompt_length`: Length of the prompt
* `prompt`: Prompt content. Redacted by default. Set `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1` to include it
* `command_name`: Command name when the prompt invokes one. Built-in and bundled command names such as `compact` or `debug` are emitted as-is; aliases such as `reset` emit as typed rather than the canonical name. Custom, plugin, and MCP command names collapse to `custom` or `mcp` unless `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1` is set
* `command_source`: Origin of the command when present: `builtin`, `custom`, or `mcp`. Plugin-provided commands report as `custom`

#### [​](#tool-result-event) Tool result event

Logged when a tool completes execution. Not emitted if the tool call was rejected; see the [Tool decision event](#tool-decision-event) for rejections.
**Event Name**: `claude_code.tool_result`
**Attributes**:

* All [standard attributes](#standard-attributes)
* `event.name`: `"tool_result"`
* `event.timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
* `event.sequence`: monotonically increasing counter for ordering events within a session
* `tool_name`: Name of the tool

* `success`: `"true"` or `"false"`
* `duration_ms`: Execution time in milliseconds
* `error_type`: Error category string when the tool failed, such as `"Error:ENOENT"` or `"ShellError"`
* `error` (when `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1`): Full error message when the tool failed
* `decision_type`: Always `"accept"`, since this event is only emitted after the tool runs. Rejected calls don’t produce a tool result
* `decision_source`: Where the permission decision came from. One of `"config"`, `"hook"`, `"user_permanent"`, or `"user_temporary"`. See the [Tool decision event](#tool-decision-event) for what each value means. The reject-only sources `"user_abort"` and `"user_reject"` never appear on this event.

  + For WorkspaceBash tool: includes `bash_command`, `full_command`, `timeout`
  + For MCP tools: includes `mcp_server_name`, `mcp_tool_name`
  + For Skill tool: includes `skill_name`

#### [​](#api-refusal-event) API refusal event

Logged when an API request returns `stop_reason: "refusal"`. Refusals arrive on a successful response stream rather than as an HTTP error, so the `api_error` event doesn’t fire for them. This event lets you track refusal frequency and group refusals by the same attributes as `api_request` and `api_error`.
**Event Name**: `claude_code.api_refusal`
**Attributes**:

* All [standard attributes](#standard-attributes)
* `event.name`: `"api_refusal"`

* `speed`: Either `"fast"` when [Fast mode](/docs/en/fast-mode) is active, or `"normal"`
* `attempt`: Retry attempt number. The first attempt is `1`.
* `effort`: [Effort level](/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) applied to the request. Absent when the model doesn’t support effort.
* `server_fallback_hop`: `true` when the API’s server-side model fallback already retried this refusal on a different model, so the user did not see this particular refusal. `false` when the request ended in a refusal. A single turn can emit both a `true` hop event and a later `false` final event when the fallback model also refuses.
* `has_category`: `true` when the API response carried a `stop_details.category` of `"cyber"`, `"bio"`, `"frontier_llm"`, or `"reasoning_extraction"`. `false` when the response carried no category or a value outside that set. Absent when `server_fallback_hop` is `true`, because hop blocks don’t carry `stop_details`.
* `has_explanation`: `true` when the API response carried a `stop_details.explanation`, otherwise `false`. Absent when `server_fallback_hop` is `true`.
* `category`: The `stop_details.category` value from the API response. One of `"cyber"`, `"bio"`, `"frontier_llm"`, or `"reasoning_extraction"`. Only present when `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1` is set and `has_category` is `true`.
* `agent.name`, `skill.name`, `plugin.name`, `marketplace.name`, `mcp_server.name`, `mcp_tool.name`: Skill, plugin, agent, and MCP attribution for the request. See [Cost counter](#cost-counter) for definitions and redaction behavior.

**Attributes**:

* All [standard attributes](#standard-attributes)
* `event.name`: `"api_request_body"`
* `event.timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
* `event.sequence`: monotonically increasing counter for ordering events within a session
* `body`: JSON-serialized Messages API request parameters (system prompt, messages, tools, etc.), truncated at 60 KB. Extended-thinking content in prior assistant turns is redacted. Emitted only in inline mode (`OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES=1`).
* `body_ref`: Absolute path to a `<dir>/<uuid>.request.json` file containing the untruncated body. Emitted only in file mode (`OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES=file:<dir>`).
* `body_length`: Untruncated body length. UTF-8 bytes when `OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES=file:<dir>`, or UTF-16 code units when `=1`

* `tool_name`: Name of the tool (for example, “Read”, “Edit”, “Write”, “NotebookEdit”)
* `tool_use_id`: Unique identifier for this tool invocation. Matches the `tool_use_id` passed to hooks, allowing correlation between OTel events and hook-captured data.
* `decision`: Either `"accept"` or `"reject"`
* `source`: Where the decision came from:
  + `"config"`: Decided automatically without prompting, based on project settings, allow or deny rules in the user’s personal settings, enterprise managed policy, `--allowedTools` or `--disallowedTools` flags, the active permission mode, a session-scoped grant from an earlier prompt in the same interactive CLI session, or because the tool is inherently safe. The event doesn’t indicate which of these sources matched.
  + `"hook"`: A `PreToolUse` or `PermissionRequest` hook returned the decision.
  + `"user_permanent"`: Emitted when the user chose “Yes, and don’t ask again for …” at a permission prompt, which saves an allow rule to their personal settings. In the interactive CLI this is emitted only for that choice itself; later calls that match the saved rule emit `"config"` instead. In Agent SDK or non-interactive `-p` sessions, both the initial choice and later rule matches emit `"user_permanent"`. Treated as an accept.
  + `"user_temporary"`: Emitted when the user chose “Yes” at a permission prompt for a one-time approval, or chose one of the ”… during this session” options on a file edit or read prompt. In the interactive CLI this is emitted only for the choice itself; later calls allowed by that session-scoped grant emit `"config"` instead. In Agent SDK or non-interactive `-p` sessions, both the choice and later matches emit `"user_temporary"`. Treated as an accept.
  + `"user_abort"`: Emitted when the user dismissed the permission prompt without answering. Treated as a reject.
  + `"user_reject"`: Emitted when the user chose “No” when prompted. In the interactive CLI this is emitted only for that choice itself; calls that match a deny rule in the user’s personal settings emit `"config"` instead. In Agent SDK or non-interactive `-p` sessions, calls that match a deny rule in personal settings emit `"user_reject"`. Treated as a reject.
* `tool_parameters` (when `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1`): JSON string containing tool-specific parameters. Same shape as the [Tool result event](#tool-result-event), minus post-execution fields such as `git_commit_id`. Values may differ from `tool_result` for an accepted call if the permission decision rewrites the tool input via `updatedInput`. Use this attribute to see which command was rejected when `decision` is `"reject"`.
  + For Bash tool: includes `bash_command`, `full_command`, `timeout`, `description`, `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`
  + For WorkspaceBash tool: includes `bash_command`, `full_command`, `timeout`
  + For MCP tools: includes `mcp_server_name`, `mcp_tool_name`

## [​](#interpret-metrics-and-events-data) Interpret metrics and events data

The exported metrics and events support a range of analyses:

### [​](#usage-monitoring) Usage monitoring

| Metric | Analysis Opportunity |
| --- | --- |
| `claude_code.token.usage` | Break down by `type` (input/output), user, team, model, `skill.name`, `plugin.name`, or `agent.name` |
| `claude_code.session.count` | Track adoption and engagement over time |
| `claude_code.lines_of_code.count` | Measure productivity by tracking code additions and removals, broken down by model |
| `claude_code.commit.count` & `claude_code.pull_request.count` | Understand impact on development workflows |

### [​](#cost-monitoring) Cost monitoring

The `claude_code.cost.usage` metric helps with:

* Tracking usage trends across teams or individuals
* Identifying high-usage sessions for optimization
* Attributing spend to specific skills, plugins, or subagent types via the `skill.name`, `plugin.name`, and `agent.name` attributes

Cost metrics are approximations. For official billing data, refer to your API provider (Claude Console, Amazon Bedrock, or Google Cloud Vertex).

### [​](#alerting-and-segmentation) Alerting and segmentation

Common alerts to consider:

* Cost spikes
* Unusual token consumption
* High session volume from specific users

All metrics can be segmented by the [standard attributes](#standard-attributes). The `model` attribute is available on `claude_code.token.usage`, `claude_code.cost.usage`, and from v2.1.172, `claude_code.lines_of_code.count`.
Per-model breakdowns of commits can only be approximated by joining against the token or cost metrics on `session.id`, since one session can span multiple models. Filter the token or cost side to rows where `query_source` is `"main"` so auxiliary and subagent requests don’t attribute the session’s commits to a model that didn’t make them.

### [​](#detect-retry-exhaustion) Detect retry exhaustion

Claude Code retries failed API requests internally and emits a single `claude_code.api_error` event only after it gives up, so the event itself is the terminal signal for that request. Intermediate retry attempts are not logged as separate events.
The `attempt` attribute on the event records how many attempts were made in total. `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES` defaults to 10 and is capped at 15. When the request exhausts all retries on a transient error, `attempt` equals one more than that effective limit: 11 by default, and never more than 16. A lower value indicates a non-retryable error such as a `400` response.
To distinguish a session that recovered from one that stalled, group events by `session.id` and check whether a later `api_request` event exists after the error.

### [​](#event-analysis) Event analysis

The event data provides detailed insights into Claude Code interactions:
**Tool usage patterns**: analyze tool result events to identify:

* Most frequently used tools
* Tool success rates
* Average tool execution times
* Error patterns by tool type

**Performance monitoring**: track API request durations and tool execution times to identify performance bottlenecks.

## [​](#audit-security-events) Audit security events

OpenTelemetry events are the audit data source for Claude Code activity. Every event carries identity attributes that tie tool calls, MCP activity, and permission decisions back to the user who triggered them. The OTLP logs exporter can deliver these events to any Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform with an OTLP receiver, or to an OpenTelemetry Collector that forwards to your SIEM.

### [​](#attribute-actions-to-users) Attribute actions to users

The [standard attributes](#standard-attributes) on each event include the authenticated user’s identity: `user.email`, `user.account_uuid`, `user.account_id`, and `organization.id` when signed in with a Claude account, plus the installation-scoped `user.id` and the per-session `session.id`.
MCP tool calls, Bash commands, and file edits are therefore attributed to the developer who started the session. Claude Code doesn’t act under a separate service account; the identity recorded on each event is the developer’s own Claude account.
When Claude Code authenticates with a direct API key, or against Bedrock, Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry, there is no Claude account in the session and only `user.id` and `session.id` are populated. In these deployments, attach user identity yourself with `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, set per user through the [managed settings](#administrator-configuration) file or a launch wrapper:

```
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="enduser.id=jdoe@example.com,enduser.directory_id=S-1-5-21-..."
```

### [​](#audit-mcp-activity) Audit MCP activity

To capture MCP server activity with full call detail, enable the logs exporter and set `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1`. Each MCP operation then produces structured events that carry the server name, tool name, and call arguments alongside the standard identity attributes:

| Event | What it records for MCP |
| --- | --- |
| `mcp_server_connection` | Server connect, disconnect, and connection failure with `server_name`, `transport_type`, `server_scope`, and error detail |
| `tool_result` | Each MCP tool call with `tool_name` and `mcp_server_scope`, a `tool_parameters` payload containing `mcp_server_name` and `mcp_tool_name`, and a `tool_input` payload containing the call arguments |
| `tool_decision` | Whether the call was allowed or denied, whether the decision came from config, a hook, or the user, and a `tool_parameters` payload containing `mcp_server_name` and `mcp_tool_name` |

Without `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS`, these events drop the identifying detail:

* `tool_result`: keeps `tool_name` and `mcp_server_scope`, omits `mcp_server_name`, `mcp_tool_name`, and arguments
* `tool_decision`: keeps `tool_name`, omits `tool_parameters`
* `mcp_server_connection`: omits `server_name` and the error message, but keeps `is_plugin`, `plugin_id_hash`, and `plugin.name`, with non-Anthropic plugin names redacted to the literal `"third-party"`, so plugin-provided servers remain distinguishable without detailed logging

### [​](#map-security-questions-to-events) Map security questions to events

When building detection rules, look up the signal you want to monitor and query your backend for the corresponding event and attributes:

| Signal | Event | Key attributes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool call allowed or denied, and by what | `tool_decision` | `decision`, `source`, `tool_name`, `tool_parameters` |
| Permission mode escalation | `permission_mode_changed` | `from_mode`, `to_mode`, `trigger` |
| Policy hook blocked an action | `hook_execution_complete` | `hook_event`, `num_blocking` |
| Login, logout, and authentication failure | `auth` | `action`, `success`, `error_category` |
| MCP server connect or failure | `mcp_server_connection` | `status`, `server_name`, `is_plugin`, `error_code` |
| Plugin installed and its source | `plugin_installed` | `plugin.name`, `marketplace.name`, `marketplace.is_official` |
| Commands run and files touched | `tool_result` (executed) or `tool_decision` (rejected) with `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1` | `tool_parameters`; `tool_input` (`tool_result` only) |

Claude Code emits the raw event stream only. Anomaly detection, baselining, correlation across sessions, and alerting are the responsibility of your SIEM or observability backend.

### [​](#send-events-to-a-siem) Send events to a SIEM

Point `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` at your SIEM’s OTLP receiver, or at an OpenTelemetry Collector that forwards to your SIEM’s native ingest API. The following managed-settings example exports events only, with full tool detail enabled for MCP and Bash auditing:

```
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS": "1",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_PROTOCOL": "http/protobuf",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT": "https://siem.example.com:4318/v1/logs",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS": "Authorization=Bearer your-siem-token"
  }
}
```

## [​](#backend-considerations) Backend considerations

Your choice of metrics, logs, and traces backends determines the types of analyses you can perform:

### [​](#for-metrics) For metrics

* **Time series databases (for example, Prometheus)**: Rate calculations, aggregated metrics
* **Columnar stores (for example, ClickHouse)**: Complex queries, unique user analysis
* **Full-featured observability platforms (for example, Honeycomb, Datadog, Grafana Cloud)**: Advanced querying, visualization, alerting

### [​](#for-events/logs) For events/logs

* **Log aggregation systems (for example, Elasticsearch, Loki)**: Full-text search, log analysis
* **Columnar stores (for example, ClickHouse)**: Structured event analysis
* **Full-featured observability platforms (for example, Honeycomb, Datadog, Grafana Cloud)**: Correlation between metrics and events

### [​](#for-traces) For traces

Choose a backend that supports distributed trace storage and span correlation:

* **Distributed tracing systems (for example, Jaeger, Zipkin, Grafana Tempo)**: Span visualization, request waterfalls, latency analysis
* **Full-featured observability platforms (for example, Honeycomb, Datadog, Grafana Cloud)**: Trace search and correlation with metrics and logs

For organizations requiring Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active User (DAU/WAU/MAU) metrics, consider backends that support efficient unique value queries.

## [​](#service-information) Service information

All metrics and events are exported with the following resource attributes:

* `service.name`: `claude-code`
* `service.version`: Current Claude Code version
* `os.type`: Operating system type (for example, `linux`, `darwin`, `windows`)
* `os.version`: Operating system version string
* `host.arch`: Host architecture (for example, `amd64`, `arm64`)
* `wsl.version`: WSL version number (only present when running on Windows Subsystem for Linux)
* Meter Name: `com.anthropic.claude_code`

## [​](#roi-measurement-resources) ROI measurement resources

For a comprehensive guide on measuring return on investment for Claude Code, including telemetry setup, cost analysis, productivity metrics, and automated reporting, see the [Claude Code ROI Measurement Guide](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-monitoring-guide). This repository provides ready-to-use Docker Compose configurations, Prometheus and OpenTelemetry setups, and templates for generating productivity reports integrated with tools like Linear.

## [​](#security-and-privacy) Security and privacy

* OpenTelemetry export to your backend is opt-in and requires explicit configuration. For Anthropic’s separate operational telemetry and how to disable it, see [Data usage](/docs/en/data-usage#telemetry-services)
* Raw file contents and code snippets are not included in metrics or events. Trace spans are a separate data path: see the `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_CONTENT` bullet below
* When authenticated via OAuth, `user.email` is included in telemetry attributes. If this is a concern for your organization, work with your telemetry backend to filter or redact this field
* User prompt content is not collected by default. Only prompt length is recorded. To include prompt content, set `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`
* Tool input arguments and parameters are not logged by default. To include them, set `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1`. This data is sent only to the OTEL endpoint you configure, never to Anthropic. Arguments may still contain sensitive values, so configure your telemetry backend to filter or redact these attributes as needed. When enabled:
  + `tool_result` and `tool_decision` events include a `tool_parameters` attribute with Bash commands, MCP server and tool names, and skill names. Fields such as `full_command` are emitted untruncated
  + `tool_result` events additionally include a `tool_input` attribute with file paths, URLs, search patterns, and other arguments. Individual values over 512 characters are truncated and the total is bounded to ~4 K characters
  + `user_prompt` events include the verbatim `command_name` for custom, plugin, and MCP commands
  + Trace spans include the same `tool_input` attribute and input-derived attributes such as `file_path`, with the same truncation as `tool_input`
* Tool input and output content is not logged in trace spans by default. To include it, set `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_CONTENT=1`. When enabled, span events include full tool input and output content truncated at 60 KB per span. This can include raw file contents from Read tool results and Bash command output. Configure your telemetry backend to filter or redact these attributes as needed
* Raw Anthropic Messages API request and response bodies are not logged by default. To include them, set `OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES`. With `=1`, each API call emits `api_request_body` and `api_response_body` log events whose `body` attribute is the JSON-serialized payload, truncated at 60 KB. With `=file:<dir>`, untruncated bodies are written to `.request.json` and `.response.json` files under that directory and the events carry a `body_ref` path instead of the inline body. Ship the directory with a log collector or sidecar rather than through the telemetry stream. In both modes, bodies contain the full conversation history (system prompt, every prior user and assistant turn, tool results), so enabling this implies consent to everything the other `OTEL_LOG_*` content flags would reveal. Claude’s extended-thinking content is always redacted from these bodies regardless of other settings

## [​](#monitor-claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock) Monitor Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock

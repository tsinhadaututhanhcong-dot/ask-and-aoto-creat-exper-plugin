# Week 21 · May 18–22, 2026 - Claude Code Docs
**Source:** [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new/2026-w21](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new/2026-w21)

Releases [v2.1.143 → v2.1.149](/docs/en/changelog#2-1-143)1 feature · May 18–22

Auto mode on the Pro planCLI

Auto mode is now available on the Pro plan and supports Sonnet 4.6 alongside Opus. It replaces permission prompts with background safety checks: routine actions run without interrupting you, and destructive or suspicious ones are blocked and surfaced.

Update Claude Code, then cycle modes with Shift+Tab; auto mode appears once your account meets the requirements:

terminal

```
claude update
```

Other wins

[`/usage`](/docs/en/costs#track-your-costs) now shows a per-category breakdown of what’s driving your plan limits, attributing recent usage to skills, subagents, plugins, and individual MCP servers

”Extra usage” is renamed to “usage credits” across the CLI, and `/extra-usage` is now `/usage-credits`. The old name still works.

New [`/code-review`](/docs/en/code-review) command reports correctness bugs at a chosen effort level such as `/code-review high`, and `—comment` posts findings as inline GitHub PR comments. `/simplify` remains as a separate cleanup-only review.

Background sessions now appear in `/resume` alongside interactive ones, marked with `bg`, and sessions pinned with `Ctrl+T` in `claude agents` stay alive when idle

`claude agents —json` lists live sessions as JSON for scripting, such as status bars and session pickers

The PowerShell tool is now enabled by default on Windows for Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry users; opt out with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=0`

`claude plugin disable` now refuses when another enabled plugin depends on the target, and `claude plugin enable` force-enables transitive dependencies

The `/plugin` marketplace browse pane shows projected context cost, and the Discover and Browse screens list a plugin’s commands, agents, skills, hooks, and MCP/LSP servers before installation

New `worktree.bgIsolation: “none”` setting lets background sessions edit the working copy directly without `EnterWorktree`, for repos where worktrees are impractical

Markdown output renders GFM task list checkboxes, and the `/diff` detail view scrolls with the keyboard

Status line JSON input now includes GitHub repo and PR information when detected

Enterprise: the `allowAllClaudeAiMcps` managed setting loads claude.ai cloud MCP connectors alongside `managed-mcp.json`

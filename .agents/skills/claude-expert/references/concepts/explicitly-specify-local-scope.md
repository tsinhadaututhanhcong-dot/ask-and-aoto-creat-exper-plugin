# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add --transport http stripe --scope local https://mcp.stripe.com
```

The command writes the server into the entry for your current project inside `~/.claude.json`. The example below shows the result when you run it from `/path/to/your/project`:

```
{
  "projects": {
    "/path/to/your/project": {
      "mcpServers": {
        "stripe": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://mcp.stripe.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### [​](#project-scope) Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project’s root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

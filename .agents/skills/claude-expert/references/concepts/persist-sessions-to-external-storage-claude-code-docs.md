# Persist sessions to external storage - Claude Code Docs
**Source:** [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/session-storage](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/session-storage)

By default, the SDK writes session transcripts to JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects/` on the local filesystem. A `SessionStore` adapter lets you mirror those transcripts to your own backend, such as S3, Redis, or a database, so a session created on one host can be resumed on another.
Common reasons to use a session store:

* **Multi-host deployments.** Serverless functions, autoscaled workers, and CI runners don’t share a filesystem. A shared store lets any replica resume any session.
* **Durability.** Local containers are ephemeral. A store backed by S3 or a database survives restarts and redeploys.
* **Compliance and audit.** Keep transcripts in storage you already govern, with your own retention rules, encryption, and access controls.

## [​](#the-sessionstore-interface) The `SessionStore` interface

A `SessionStore` is an object with two required methods, `append` and `load`, and three optional methods. The SDK calls `append` to write transcript entries during a query and `load` to read them back for resume.

TypeScript

Python

```
// Exported from @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk as
// SessionStore, SessionKey, SessionStoreEntry.

type SessionKey = {
  projectKey: string;
  sessionId: string;
  subpath?: string;
};

type SessionStore = {
  // Required
  append(key: SessionKey, entries: SessionStoreEntry[]): Promise<void>;
  load(key: SessionKey): Promise<SessionStoreEntry[] | null>;

  // Optional
  listSessions?(
    projectKey: string,
  ): Promise<Array<{ sessionId: string; mtime: number }>>;
  delete?(key: SessionKey): Promise<void>;
  listSubkeys?(key: {
    projectKey: string;
    sessionId: string;
  }): Promise<string[]>;
};
```

`SessionKey` addresses one transcript. `projectKey` is a stable, filesystem-safe encoding of the working directory, `sessionId` is the session UUID, and `subpath` is set when the entry belongs to a subagent transcript or sidecar file rather than the main conversation. Treat `subpath` as an opaque key suffix; it follows the on-disk layout, for example `subagents/agent-<id>`. When `subpath` is undefined the key refers to the main transcript.

| Method | Required | Called when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `append` | Yes | After each batch of transcript entries is written locally. Entries are JSON-safe objects, one per line in the local JSONL. |
| `load` | Yes | Once before the subprocess spawns, when `resume` is set. Return `null` if the session is unknown. |
| `listSessions` | No | By `listSessions({ sessionStore })` and by `query()`/`startup()` with `continue: true`. If undefined, those calls throw. |
| `delete` | No | By `deleteSession({ sessionStore })`. Deleting the main key (no `subpath`) must cascade to all subkeys for that session. If undefined, deletion is a no-op, which suits append-only backends. |
| `listSubkeys` | No | During resume, to discover subagent transcripts. If undefined, only the main transcript is restored. |

## [​](#quick-start) Quick start

The SDK ships an `InMemorySessionStore` for development and testing. The example below runs a query with the store attached, captures the session ID from the result message, then resumes from the store in a second `query()` call. The second call passes the same store instance plus `resume`, so the SDK loads the transcript from the store instead of the local filesystem:

TypeScript

Python

```
import { query, InMemorySessionStore } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const store = new InMemorySessionStore();

let sessionId: string | undefined;
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "List the TypeScript files under src/",
  options: { sessionStore: store },
})) {
  if (message.type === "result") {
    sessionId = message.session_id;
  }
}

// Resume from the store. The agent has full context from the first call.
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Summarize what those files do",
  options: { sessionStore: store, resume: sessionId },
})) {
  if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
    console.log(message.result);
  }
}
```

The second query prints a summary of the files from the first query, which shows the agent resumed with full context from the store.

## [​](#write-your-own-adapter) Write your own adapter

Implement `append` and `load` against your backend. Add `listSessions`, `delete`, and `listSubkeys` if you want `listSessions()`, `deleteSession()`, and subagent resume to work against the store.
Entries passed to `append` are typed as `SessionStoreEntry` (a `{ type: string; ... }` object). Treat them as opaque JSON-safe values: persist them in order and return them from `load` in the same order. `load` must return entries that are deep-equal to what was appended; byte-equal serialization is not required, so backends like Postgres `jsonb` that reorder object keys are fine.

## [​](#reference-implementations) Reference implementations

The TypeScript SDK repository includes runnable reference adapters for S3, Redis, and Postgres under [`examples/session-stores/`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/tree/main/examples/session-stores). They are not published to npm; copy the `src/` file you need into your project and install the corresponding backend client.

| Adapter | Backend client | Storage model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`S3SessionStore`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/tree/main/examples/session-stores/s3) | `@aws-sdk/client-s3` | One JSONL part file per `append()`; `load()` lists, sorts, and concatenates. |
| [`RedisSessionStore`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/tree/main/examples/session-stores/redis) | `ioredis` | `RPUSH`/`LRANGE` list per transcript, plus a sorted-set session index. |
| [`PostgresSessionStore`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/tree/main/examples/session-stores/postgres) | `pg` | One row per entry in a `jsonb` table, ordered by `BIGSERIAL`. |

Each adapter takes a pre-configured client instance, so you control credentials, TLS, region, and pooling. For example, with S3:

TypeScript

```
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { S3SessionStore } from "./S3SessionStore"; // copied from examples/session-stores/s3

const store = new S3SessionStore({
  bucket: "my-claude-sessions",
  prefix: "transcripts",
  client: new S3Client({ region: "us-east-1" }),
});

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Hello!",
  options: { sessionStore: store },
})) {
  if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
    console.log(message.result);
  }
}

// Later, possibly on a different host:
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Continue where we left off",
  options: { sessionStore: store, resume: "previous-session-id" },
})) {
  // ...
}
```

### [​](#validate-your-adapter) Validate your adapter

Both SDKs ship a conformance suite that asserts the behavioral contract `append`, `load`, and the optional methods must satisfy. Tests for optional methods skip automatically when those methods are not implemented.
In TypeScript, copy [`shared/conformance.ts`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/blob/main/examples/session-stores/shared/conformance.ts) from the example directory into your test suite. In Python, the suite ships in the package:

Python

```
import pytest
from claude_agent_sdk.testing import run_session_store_conformance


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_store_conformance():
    await run_session_store_conformance(MyRedisStore)
```

## [​](#behavior-notes) Behavior notes

### [​](#dual-write-architecture) Dual-write architecture

The store is a mirror, not a replacement. The Claude Code subprocess always writes to local disk first; the SDK then forwards each batch to `append()`. If you want the local copy to be ephemeral, point `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at a temp directory in `options.env`. Because the mirror depends on local writes, `sessionStore` cannot be combined with `persistSession: false`; the SDK throws if you set both. It also throws if combined with `enableFileCheckpointing`, since file-history backup blobs are written directly to local disk and are not mirrored to the store.

### [​](#mirror-writes-are-best-effort) Mirror writes are best-effort

If `append()` rejects or times out, the error is logged, a `{ type: "system", subtype: "mirror_error" }` message is emitted into the iterator, and the query continues. The local transcript is already durable on disk, so a store outage does not interrupt the agent or lose data locally. Batches that fail are not retried, so monitor for `mirror_error` if you need to detect store data loss.

### [​](#getsessionmessages-returns-the-post-compaction-chain) `getSessionMessages` returns the post-compaction chain

`getSessionMessages({ sessionStore })` returns the linked message chain the agent would see on resume. After auto-compaction, earlier turns are replaced by a summary, so a session whose store holds 503 raw entries may return 18 messages from `getSessionMessages`. For the full raw history, including pre-compaction turns and metadata entries, call `store.load(key)` directly.

### [​](#forksession-is-not-a-byte-copy) `forkSession` is not a byte copy

`forkSession({ sessionStore })` reads the source entries, rewrites every `sessionId` field and remaps message UUIDs, then appends the transformed entries under a new key. An adapter-level copy or `CopyObject` shortcut would produce a transcript that still references the old session ID, so the SDK does not use one.

### [​](#subagent-transcripts) Subagent transcripts

Subagent transcripts are mirrored under `subpath: "subagents/agent-<id>"`. `listSubagents({ sessionStore })` requires the adapter to implement `listSubkeys`; `getSubagentMessages({ sessionStore })` uses it when available but falls back to the direct subpath when it is undefined. Resume also calls `listSubkeys` to restore subagent files; without it, only the main transcript is materialized.

### [​](#retention) Retention

The SDK never deletes from your store on its own. Retention is the adapter’s responsibility: implement TTLs, S3 lifecycle policies, or scheduled cleanup according to your compliance requirements. Local transcripts under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` are swept independently by the `cleanupPeriodDays` setting.

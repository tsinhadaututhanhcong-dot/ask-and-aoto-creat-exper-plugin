    """Get server version, check for updates, and report auth status.

    AI assistants: If update_available is True, inform the user that a new
    version is available and suggest updating with the provided command.

    auth_status is the result of an AuthHealthChecker probe. The checker
    runs a multi-probe strategy (homepage fetch + API fallback) with
    30-second TTL caching and mtime-based bypass on auth-file changes.
    The reported value may therefore be up to 30 seconds old, and an
    external `nlm login` is picked up within one check cycle without
    waiting for the TTL to expire.

    auth_status meanings:
    - "configured"     — homepage (or API fallback) check passed; credentials
                         are good. Cached credentials may be reported as
                         configured for up to 30 seconds.
    - "not_configured" — no credentials are stored (first-time setup).
    - "stale"          — credentials are known-bad (expired or past the
                         7-day heuristic). Operations will fail; ask the
                         user to run `nlm login` to refresh.
    - "unverified"     — the check could not be completed (network error,
                         timeout, non-200 response). Cached credentials may
                         still work for actual API calls, so do not assume
                         the user needs to re-auth.
    - "error"          — unexpected exception inside the check itself.

    Returns:
        dict with version info:
        - version: Current installed version
        - latest_version: Latest version on PyPI (or None if check failed)
        - update_available: True if a newer version is available
        - auth_status: configured | stale | unverified | not_configured | error
        - update_command: Command to run to update

# Getting Started

A practical guide to going from "just installed" to "NotebookLM is wired
into my agent." For background on what the project is and the full feature
list, see the [README](../README.md). For deep command/tool reference, see
the [CLI Guide](CLI_GUIDE.md) and [MCP Guide](MCP_GUIDE.md).

## First-time setup

If you have never used `notebooklm-mcp-cli` before, the path is:

1. **Install** — `uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli`. This gives you both
   the `nlm` CLI and the `notebooklm-mcp` server binary. See the
   [README → Installation](../README.md#installation) section for
   alternatives (`uvx`, `pip`, `pipx`, source install).
2. **Authenticate** — `nlm login`. The CLI extracts your Google cookies
   from a managed browser session. See the
   [Authentication Guide](AUTHENTICATION.md) for the two supported methods
   (Auto Mode and File Mode) and how multi-profile auth works.
3. **Connect an agent** — pick your client:
   ```bash
   nlm skill install hermes          # Hermes Agent
   claude mcp add notebooklm-mcp -- notebooklm-mcp   # Claude Code
   gemini mcp add --scope user notebooklm-mcp -- notebooklm-mcp   # Gemini CLI
   nlm setup add json                # any other MCP client (prints JSON)
   ```
4. **Verify** — restart your agent and call `notebook_list` (MCP) or
   `nlm notebook list` (CLI). If you see your existing notebooks, you are
   good to go.

## Migrating from another NotebookLM MCP

If you previously used a browser-automation–based NotebookLM MCP (or any
other third-party NotebookLM server) and want to switch to
`notebooklm-mcp-cli` for direct API access, follow these steps. Most agent
frameworks (Hermes Agent, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) get confused when two
NotebookLM servers are configured at the same time because their tool
names overlap (`notebook_create`, `source_add`, …), so a clean swap is
recommended.

### 1. Install the unified CLI/MCP

```bash
uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli
```

This installs both `nlm` and the `notebooklm-mcp` server binary.

### 2. Authenticate once

```bash
nlm login
```

Your Google cookies are extracted from a managed browser session and
cached in `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/profiles/default/auth.json`. The
`nlm login --check` command verifies that the cached creds still work.

### 3. Register the new MCP server

Pick whichever fits your agent framework:

```bash
# Hermes Agent
nlm skill install hermes

# Claude Code
claude mcp add notebooklm-mcp -- notebooklm-mcp

# Gemini CLI
gemini mcp add --scope user notebooklm-mcp -- notebooklm-mcp
```

For any other MCP client, generate a config snippet:

```bash
nlm setup add json
```

> **Recommended server name:** `notebooklm-mcp` (the default). Avoid
> generic names like `notebooklm` if you also have a legacy server
> registered, or your agent will mix their tools up.

### 4. Remove the old MCP server

This is the step most people forget. Leaving both configured is the #1
cause of "Hermes picked the wrong tool" symptoms:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp remove notebooklm          # (or whatever the old name was)

# Gemini CLI
gemini mcp remove notebooklm

# Hermes / others: edit the client config directly
```

If you are not sure what is registered, list everything:

```bash
claude mcp list                       # Claude Code
gemini mcp list                       # Gemini CLI
```

### 5. Restart your agent

Restart Claude Code / Cursor / Gemini / Hermes so the new tool list is
reloaded. Verify with a no-op call such as `notebook_list` (via the MCP)
or `nlm notebook list` (via the CLI).

## Troubleshooting

- **Auth setup issues** — see the
  [Authentication Guide → Troubleshooting](AUTHENTICATION.md#troubleshooting).
- **"Hermes picked the wrong tool"** — you almost certainly have two
  NotebookLM servers registered. See step 4 of the
  [migration section](#migrating-from-another-notebooklm-mcp) above.
- **`auth_status` says `"stale"`** — re-run `nlm login`. See
  [Understanding `auth_status`](AUTHENTICATION.md#understanding-auth_status)
  for the difference between `stale` and `unverified`.
- **Run the full diagnostic** — `nlm doctor` checks storage, auth, browser,
  and MCP wiring in one go.

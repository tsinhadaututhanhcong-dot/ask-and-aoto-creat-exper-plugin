### Antigravity Guide, audio support, search improvements, and performance fixes

New built-in Antigravity Guide skill, audio file rendering, improved substring file search, performance optimizations, and critical bug fixes.

Improvements (19)

* Added a new built-in Antigravity Guide skill to provide helpful guidance when users ask about Antigravity.
* Added syntax highlighting for C++, Python, and Protobuf files in markdown code and diff blocks.
* Added hover tooltips to file pills in the chat and workspace views to display absolute paths and clarify workspace locations.
* Improved readability of context pills by truncating long labels and adding hover tooltips to view the full content.
* Enabled automatic saving of refreshed OAuth tokens to the OS keyring to reduce authentication prompts.
* Added support for rendering and playing audio files (.mp3, .wav, .ogg, .m4a) within the sidebar file viewer and artifact viewer.
* Added a new 'Conversation Width' setting under Appearance settings, allowing you to configure the maximum width of the conversation panel (Default, Narrow, or Wide).
* When creating a new project, Antigravity 2.0 will now notify you if a project with the same folders already exists, allowing you to quickly navigate to it.
* Added a tooltip to show the full task summary when hovering over items in the Running Items panel.
* Improved the model selector dropdown to dynamically resize and prevent truncation of long model names.
* Updated the permissions request dialog to display a clear description of the action or command being run.
* Improved response time and reliability of account status checks when Terms of Service violations are encountered.
* Improved UI responsiveness and eliminated lag when resizing the sidebar layout.
* Aligned theme colors, font sizes, text size, and line height in the chat input area to match surrounding UI density and ensure consistent rendering.
* Improved usability for touch and stylus users by increasing the size of various UI hit targets, including buttons, pills, and toolbars.
* Adjusted the diff viewer layout to provide more horizontal space for code contents.
* Added a brief delay before displaying tooltips for long conversation titles in the sidebar.
* Optimized file watching notifications to prevent visual flickering and improve performance during high-frequency file writes.
* Updated icons for built-in slash commands and redesigned mentions/slash commands menu alignment in the chat input box.
Fixes (17)

* Fixed an issue with broken text selection anchoring when adding comments to files or artifacts.
* Fixed an issue where workspace context was lost when navigating to the history page or other views.
* Fixed performance issues, rendering loops, and lag when navigating folders using the file path breadcrumbs or the file tree.
* Fixed erratic behavior and lag in slash command autocomplete during network instability.
* Improved file search in your workspace by matching substrings instead of requiring exact prefix matches.
* Fixed an issue where file search within workspaces could fail with a 'No such file or directory' error.
* Fixed an issue where allowing commands with special characters (like dots or environment variables) could trigger an infinite permission prompt loop.
* Improved command execution permission matching to support prefix-matching for build/test commands and correct handling of quoted arguments.
* Fixed issues where in-progress prompts and local history edits were discarded during navigation or permission checks.
* Fixed an issue where custom theme settings and color modes were not correctly applied on startup, including rejecting hex codes with a leading '#' symbol.
* Fixed startup issues and recurring User Account Control (UAC) prompts on Windows by registering a scheduled task and resolving access control errors on system PATH directories.
* Fixed crashes and synchronization issues when deleting persistent state across tabs.
* Improved accessibility and usability of the artifact review dialog, including contrast, tooltips, and error messaging.
* Fixed an issue where the agent was blocked from reading builtin customizations and skills due to sandbox restrictions.
* Fixed a startup race condition that could cause duplicate project folders to be created.
* Fixed a deadlock issue that could cause subagents to hang during execution.
* Fixed a potential crash when calculating token usage.

June 11, 2026

### Quota Screen Redesign and PDF Support

Quota screen redesign, PDF attachment support, new /btw slash command, and other bug fixes

Improvements (7)

* Quota screen redesign: clearer, unambiguous view into “used” versus “remaining” credits in the Models tab of the Settings screen.
* Ask side questions via /btw: while in a conversation, type ‘/btw’ in the input and select the ‘btw’ option in the menu to write a message to an ephemeral, single-response agent that has the context of your current conversation.
* Simple conversation search functionality: cmd/ctrl+F to search for visible text in the conversation view.
* Support for PDF attachments to messages to Gemini models: drag and drop PDFs from your filesystem or add PDFs using the media option in the Add Context menu button in the input box.
* Breadcrumbs in file viewer pane header: quality-of-life UI to more easily see and navigate directories in your repo.
* Nested subagents in the overview pane: see all nested subagents belonging to the main conversation instead of only the subagents that are one level deep.
* Minor improvements to Projects UX: you can now specify a project name during the creation flow and sort conversations in the left sidebar by worktree.
Fixes (4)

* Improved LaTeX support: the agent has a better understanding and awareness of its ability to output LaTeX-rendered math text.
* Improved MCP server stability: increased resilience to unresponsive MCP servers and improved browser agent self-troubleshooting abilities when using the Chrome DevTools MCP server.
* MCP server schema compatibility: the mcp\_config.json schema now accepts url in addition to serverUrl as a field.
* New entries in the sensitive paths list: .vscode and .cache are now recognized as sensitive paths that require explicit user confirmation before the agent can access them.

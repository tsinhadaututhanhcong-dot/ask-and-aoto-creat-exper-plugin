info

The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.

# Parallel CLI

Use `parallel-cli` when the user explicitly wants Parallel, or when a terminal-native workflow would benefit from Parallel's vendor-specific stack for web search, extraction, deep research, enrichment, entity discovery, or monitoring.

This is an optional third-party workflow, not a Hermes core capability.

Important expectations:

* Parallel is a paid service with a free tier, not a fully free local tool.
* It overlaps with Hermes native `web_search` / `web_extract`, so do not prefer it by default for ordinary lookups.
* Prefer this skill when the user mentions Parallel specifically or needs capabilities like Parallel's enrichment, FindAll, or monitor workflows.

`parallel-cli` is designed for agents:

* JSON output via `--json`
* Non-interactive command execution
* Async long-running jobs with `--no-wait`, `status`, and `poll`
* Context chaining with `--previous-interaction-id`
* Search, extract, research, enrichment, entity discovery, and monitoring in one CLI

## When to use it[​](#when-to-use-it "Direct link to When to use it")

Prefer this skill when:

* The user explicitly mentions Parallel or `parallel-cli`
* The task needs richer workflows than a simple one-shot search/extract pass
* You need async deep research jobs that can be launched and polled later
* You need structured enrichment, FindAll entity discovery, or monitoring

Prefer Hermes native `web_search` / `web_extract` for quick one-off lookups when Parallel is not specifically requested.

## Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

Try the least invasive install path available for the environment.

### Homebrew[​](#homebrew "Direct link to Homebrew")

```
brew install parallel-web/tap/parallel-cli
```

### npm[​](#npm "Direct link to npm")

```
npm install -g parallel-web-cli
```

### Python package[​](#python-package "Direct link to Python package")

```
pip install "parallel-web-tools[cli]"
```

### Standalone installer[​](#standalone-installer "Direct link to Standalone installer")

```
curl -fsSL https://parallel.ai/install.sh | bash
```

If you want an isolated Python install, `pipx` can also work:

```
pipx install "parallel-web-tools[cli]"  
pipx ensurepath
```

## Authentication[​](#authentication "Direct link to Authentication")

Interactive login:

```
parallel-cli login
```

Headless / SSH / CI:

```
parallel-cli login --device
```

API key environment variable:

```
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="***"
```

Verify current auth status:

```
parallel-cli auth
```

If auth requires browser interaction, run with `pty=true`.

## Core rule set[​](#core-rule-set "Direct link to Core rule set")

1. Always prefer `--json` when you need machine-readable output.
2. Prefer explicit arguments and non-interactive flows.
3. For long-running jobs, use `--no-wait` and then `status` / `poll`.
4. Cite only URLs returned by the CLI output.
5. Save large JSON outputs to a temp file when follow-up questions are likely.
6. Use background processes only for genuinely long-running workflows; otherwise run in foreground.
7. Prefer Hermes native tools unless the user wants Parallel specifically or needs Parallel-only workflows.

## Quick reference[​](#quick-reference "Direct link to Quick reference")

```

## Common flags and patterns[​](#common-flags-and-patterns "Direct link to Common flags and patterns")

Commonly useful flags:

* `--json` for structured output
* `--no-wait` for async jobs
* `--previous-interaction-id <id>` for follow-up tasks that reuse earlier context
* `--max-results <n>` for search result count
* `--mode one-shot|agentic` for search behavior
* `--include-domains domain1.com,domain2.com`
* `--exclude-domains domain1.com,domain2.com`
* `--after-date YYYY-MM-DD`

Read from stdin when convenient:

```
echo "What is the latest funding for Anthropic?" | parallel-cli search - --json  
echo "Research question" | parallel-cli research run - --json
```

## Search[​](#search "Direct link to Search")

Use for current web lookups with structured results.

```
parallel-cli search "What is Anthropic's latest AI model?" --json  
parallel-cli search "SEC filings for Apple" --include-domains sec.gov --json  
parallel-cli search "bitcoin price" --after-date 2026-01-01 --max-results 10 --json  
parallel-cli search "latest browser benchmarks" --mode one-shot --json  
parallel-cli search "AI coding agent enterprise reviews" --mode agentic --json
```

Useful constraints:

* `--include-domains` to narrow trusted sources
* `--exclude-domains` to strip noisy domains
* `--after-date` for recency filtering
* `--max-results` when you need broader coverage

If you expect follow-up questions, save output:

```
parallel-cli search "latest React 19 changes" --json -o /tmp/react-19-search.json
```

When summarizing results:

* lead with the answer
* include dates, names, and concrete facts
* cite only returned sources
* avoid inventing URLs or source titles

## Extraction[​](#extraction "Direct link to Extraction")

Use to pull clean content or markdown from a URL.

```
parallel-cli extract https://example.com --json  
parallel-cli extract https://company.com --objective "Find pricing info" --json  
parallel-cli extract https://example.com --full-content --json  
parallel-cli fetch https://example.com --json
```

Use `--objective` when the page is broad and you only need one slice of information.

## Deep research[​](#deep-research "Direct link to Deep research")

Use for deeper multi-step research tasks that may take time.

Common processor tiers:

* `lite` / `base` for faster, cheaper passes
* `core` / `pro` for more thorough synthesis
* `ultra` for the heaviest research jobs

### Synchronous[​](#synchronous "Direct link to Synchronous")

```
parallel-cli research run \  
  "Compare the leading AI coding agents by pricing, model support, and enterprise controls" \  
  --processor core \  
  --json
```

### Async launch + poll[​](#async-launch--poll "Direct link to Async launch + poll")

```
parallel-cli research run \  
  "Compare the leading AI coding agents by pricing, model support, and enterprise controls" \  
  --processor ultra \  
  --no-wait \  
  --json  
  
parallel-cli research status trun_xxx --json  
parallel-cli research poll trun_xxx --json  
parallel-cli research processors --json
```

### Context chaining / follow-up[​](#context-chaining--follow-up "Direct link to Context chaining / follow-up")

```
parallel-cli research run "What are the top AI coding agents?" --json  
parallel-cli research run \  
  "What enterprise controls does the top-ranked one offer?" \  
  --previous-interaction-id trun_xxx \  
  --json
```

Recommended Hermes workflow:

1. launch with `--no-wait --json`
2. capture the returned run/task ID
3. if the user wants to continue other work, keep moving
4. later call `status` or `poll`
5. summarize the final report with citations from the returned sources

## Enrichment[​](#enrichment "Direct link to Enrichment")

Use when the user has CSV/JSON/tabular inputs and wants additional columns inferred from web research.

### Suggest columns[​](#suggest-columns "Direct link to Suggest columns")

```
parallel-cli enrich suggest "Find the CEO and annual revenue" --json
```

### Plan a config[​](#plan-a-config "Direct link to Plan a config")

```
parallel-cli enrich plan -o config.yaml
```

### Inline data[​](#inline-data "Direct link to Inline data")

```
parallel-cli enrich run \  
  --data '[{"company": "Anthropic"}, {"company": "Mistral"}]' \  
  --intent "Find headquarters and employee count" \  
  --json
```

### Non-interactive file run[​](#non-interactive-file-run "Direct link to Non-interactive file run")

```
parallel-cli enrich run \  
  --source-type csv \  
  --source companies.csv \  
  --target enriched.csv \  
  --source-columns '[{"name": "company", "description": "Company name"}]' \  
  --intent "Find the CEO and annual revenue"
```

### YAML config run[​](#yaml-config-run "Direct link to YAML config run")

```
parallel-cli enrich run config.yaml
```

### Status / polling[​](#status--polling "Direct link to Status / polling")

```
parallel-cli enrich status <task_group_id> --json  
parallel-cli enrich poll <task_group_id> --json
```

Use explicit JSON arrays for column definitions when operating non-interactively.
Validate the output file before reporting success.

## FindAll[​](#findall "Direct link to FindAll")

Use for web-scale entity discovery when the user wants a discovered dataset rather than a short answer.

```
parallel-cli findall run "Find AI coding agent startups with enterprise offerings" --json  
parallel-cli findall run "AI startups in healthcare" -n 25 --json  
parallel-cli findall status <run_id> --json  
parallel-cli findall poll <run_id> --json  
parallel-cli findall result <run_id> --json  
parallel-cli findall schema <run_id> --json
```

This is a better fit than ordinary search when the user wants a discovered set of entities that can be reviewed, filtered, or enriched later.

## Monitor[​](#monitor "Direct link to Monitor")

Use for ongoing change detection over time.

```
parallel-cli monitor list --json  
parallel-cli monitor get <monitor_id> --json  
parallel-cli monitor events <monitor_id> --json  
parallel-cli monitor delete <monitor_id> --json
```

Creation is usually the sensitive part because cadence and delivery matter:

```
parallel-cli monitor create --help
```

Use this when the user wants recurring tracking of a page or source rather than a one-time fetch.

## Recommended Hermes usage patterns[​](#recommended-hermes-usage-patterns "Direct link to Recommended Hermes usage patterns")

### Fast answer with citations[​](#fast-answer-with-citations "Direct link to Fast answer with citations")

1. Run `parallel-cli search ... --json`
2. Parse titles, URLs, dates, excerpts
3. Summarize with inline citations from the returned URLs only

### URL investigation[​](#url-investigation "Direct link to URL investigation")

1. Run `parallel-cli extract URL --json`
2. If needed, rerun with `--objective` or `--full-content`
3. Quote or summarize the extracted markdown

### Long research workflow[​](#long-research-workflow "Direct link to Long research workflow")

1. Run `parallel-cli research run ... --no-wait --json`
2. Store the returned ID
3. Continue other work or periodically poll
4. Summarize the final report with citations

### Structured enrichment workflow[​](#structured-enrichment-workflow "Direct link to Structured enrichment workflow")

1. Inspect the input file and columns
2. Use `enrich suggest` or provide explicit enriched columns
3. Run `enrich run`
4. Poll for completion if needed
5. Validate the output file before reporting success

## Error handling and exit codes[​](#error-handling-and-exit-codes "Direct link to Error handling and exit codes")

The CLI documents these exit codes:

* `0` success
* `2` bad input
* `3` auth error
* `4` API error
* `5` timeout

If you hit auth errors:

1. check `parallel-cli auth`
2. confirm `PARALLEL_API_KEY` or run `parallel-cli login` / `parallel-cli login --device`
3. verify `parallel-cli` is on `PATH`

## Maintenance[​](#maintenance "Direct link to Maintenance")

Check current auth / install state:

```
parallel-cli auth  
parallel-cli --help
```

Update commands:

```
parallel-cli update  
pip install --upgrade parallel-web-tools  
parallel-cli config auto-update-check off
```

## Pitfalls[​](#pitfalls "Direct link to Pitfalls")

* Do not omit `--json` unless the user explicitly wants human-formatted output.
* Do not cite sources not present in the CLI output.
* `login` may require PTY/browser interaction.
* Prefer foreground execution for short tasks; do not overuse background processes.
* For large result sets, save JSON to `/tmp/*.json` instead of stuffing everything into context.
* Do not silently choose Parallel when Hermes native tools are already sufficient.
* Remember this is a vendor workflow that usually requires account auth and paid usage beyond the free tier.

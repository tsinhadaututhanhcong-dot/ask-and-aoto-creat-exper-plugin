info

The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.

# Apple Notes

Use `memo` to manage Apple Notes directly from the terminal. Notes sync across all Apple devices via iCloud.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* **macOS** with Notes.app
* Install: `brew tap antoniorodr/memo && brew install antoniorodr/memo/memo`
* Grant Automation access to Notes.app when prompted (System Settings → Privacy → Automation)

## When to Use[​](#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")

* User asks to create, view, or search Apple Notes
* Saving information to Notes.app for cross-device access
* Organizing notes into folders
* Exporting notes to Markdown/HTML

## When NOT to Use[​](#when-not-to-use "Direct link to When NOT to Use")

* Obsidian vault management → use the `obsidian` skill
* Bear Notes → separate app (not supported here)
* Quick agent-only notes → use the `memory` tool instead

## Quick Reference[​](#quick-reference "Direct link to Quick Reference")

### View Notes[​](#view-notes "Direct link to View Notes")

```
memo notes                        # List all notes  
memo notes -f "Folder Name"       # Filter by folder  
memo notes -s "query"             # Search notes (fuzzy)
```

### Create Notes[​](#create-notes "Direct link to Create Notes")

```
memo notes -a                     # Interactive editor  
memo notes -a "Note Title"        # Quick add with title
```

### Edit Notes[​](#edit-notes "Direct link to Edit Notes")

```
memo notes -e                     # Interactive selection to edit
```

### Delete Notes[​](#delete-notes "Direct link to Delete Notes")

memo notes -d                     # Interactive selection to delete
```

### Move Notes[​](#move-notes "Direct link to Move Notes")

memo notes -m                     # Move note to folder (interactive)
```

### Export Notes[​](#export-notes "Direct link to Export Notes")

```
memo notes -ex                    # Export to HTML/Markdown
```

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

* Cannot edit notes containing images or attachments
* Interactive prompts require terminal access (use pty=true if needed)
* macOS only — requires Apple Notes.app

## Rules[​](#rules "Direct link to Rules")

1. Prefer Apple Notes when user wants cross-device sync (iPhone/iPad/Mac)
2. Use the `memory` tool for agent-internal notes that don't need to sync
3. Use the `obsidian` skill for Markdown-native knowledge management

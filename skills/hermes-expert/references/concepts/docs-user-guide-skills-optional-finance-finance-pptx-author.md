Build PowerPoint decks headless with python-pptx. Pairs with excel-author for model-backed decks where every number traces to a workbook cell. Use for pitch decks, IC memos, earnings notes.

info

The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.

# pptx-author

Produce a .pptx file on disk using `python-pptx`. Use when you need to deliver a deck as a file artifact, not drive a live PowerPoint session.

Adapted from Anthropic's `pptx-author` and `pitch-deck` skills in [anthropics/financial-services](https://github.com/anthropics/financial-services). The MCP / Office-JS branches of the originals are dropped — this assumes headless Python.

For the broader, already-shipped PowerPoint authoring skill (slides, speaker notes, embeds, media), see the built-in `powerpoint` skill. This skill is a lighter-weight pattern tuned for model-backed decks (pitch decks, IC memos, earnings notes) where every number must trace to a source workbook.

## Output contract[​](#output-contract "Direct link to Output contract")

* Write to `./out/<name>.pptx`. Create `./out/` if it does not exist.
* Return the relative path in your final message.

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

```
pip install "python-pptx>=0.6"
```

## Core conventions[​](#core-conventions "Direct link to Core conventions")

### One idea per slide[​](#one-idea-per-slide "Direct link to One idea per slide")

Title states the takeaway; body supports it. A slide titled "Q3 Revenue" is weak; "Revenue growth accelerated to 14% Y/Y in Q3" is strong.

### Every number traces to the model[​](#every-number-traces-to-the-model "Direct link to Every number traces to the model")

If a figure on a slide came from `./out/model.xlsx`, footnote the sheet and cell.

```
Revenue: $1,250M  (Source: model.xlsx, Inputs!C3)
```

Never transcribe numbers from memory or from a summary — open the workbook, read the named range, and bind the deck value to it programmatically when you can.

### Use the firm template when one is mounted[​](#use-the-firm-template-when-one-is-mounted "Direct link to Use the firm template when one is mounted")

If `./templates/firm-template.pptx` exists, load it so the deck inherits branded colors, fonts, and master layouts.

```
from pptx import Presentation  
from pathlib import Path  
  
template = Path("./templates/firm-template.pptx")  
prs = Presentation(str(template)) if template.exists() else Presentation()
```

### Charts: PNG-from-model beats native pptx charts[​](#charts-png-from-model-beats-native-pptx-charts "Direct link to Charts: PNG-from-model beats native pptx charts")

When fidelity matters (the model's chart styling must match the deck exactly), render the chart to PNG from the source workbook and embed the image. Native `pptx.chart` charts are fragile and often don't match firm conventions.

```
from pptx.util import Inches  
slide.shapes.add_picture("./out/charts/football_field.png",  
                         Inches(1), Inches(2),  
                         width=Inches(8))
```

### No external sends[​](#no-external-sends "Direct link to No external sends")

This skill writes a file. It never emails, uploads, or posts. Orchestration layers handle delivery.

## Skeleton[​](#skeleton "Direct link to Skeleton")

```
from pptx import Presentation  
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt  
from pptx.dml.color import RGBColor  
from pathlib import Path  
  
template = Path("./templates/firm-template.pptx")  
prs = Presentation(str(template)) if template.exists() else Presentation()  
  
# Title slide  
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[0])  
slide.shapes.title.text = "Project Aurora — Strategic Alternatives"  
slide.placeholders[1].text = "Preliminary Discussion Materials"  
  
# Valuation summary slide (title-only layout)  
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[5])  
slide.shapes.title.text = "Valuation implies $38–$52 per share across methodologies"  
  
# Add a table bound to model outputs  
rows, cols = 5, 4  
tbl_shape = slide.shapes.add_table(rows, cols,  
                                   Inches(0.5), Inches(1.5),  
                                   Inches(9), Inches(3))  
tbl = tbl_shape.table  
headers = ["Methodology", "Low ($)", "Mid ($)", "High ($)"]  
for c, h in enumerate(headers):  
    tbl.cell(0, c).text = h  
  
# In a real deck, read these from the model workbook with openpyxl  
data = [  
    ("Trading comps",     "35", "41", "48"),  
    ("Precedent M&A",     "39", "45", "52"),  
    ("DCF (base)",        "36", "43", "51"),  
    ("LBO (10% IRR)",     "33", "38", "44"),  
]  
for r, row in enumerate(data, start=1):  
    for c, val in enumerate(row):  
        tbl.cell(r, c).text = val  
  
# Embed a chart rendered from the model  
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[5])  
slide.shapes.title.text = "Football field — current price $42"  
slide.shapes.add_picture("./out/charts/football_field.png",  
                         Inches(1), Inches(1.8), width=Inches(8))  
  
Path("./out").mkdir(exist_ok=True)  
prs.save("./out/pitch-aurora.pptx")
```

## Binding deck numbers to the source workbook[​](#binding-deck-numbers-to-the-source-workbook "Direct link to Binding deck numbers to the source workbook")

Read named ranges or specific cells from your Excel model so deck numbers never drift.

```
from openpyxl import load_workbook  
  
wb = load_workbook("./out/model.xlsx", data_only=True)  
def nr(name):  
    """Resolve a named range to its current computed value."""  
    rng = wb.defined_names[name]  
    sheet, coord = next(rng.destinations)  
    return wb[sheet][coord].value  
  
revenue_fy24 = nr("RevenueFY24")  
implied_mid  = nr("ImpliedSharePriceBase")
```

Then build deck content using those values:

```
slide.shapes.title.text = f"Implied share price of ${implied_mid:.2f} (base case)"
```

Remember to recalculate the workbook before reading it — openpyxl only sees computed values if something has already calculated the sheet. Run the recalc helper in the `excel-author` skill first, or open/save through a real Excel session.

## Slide-type checklist for pitch decks[​](#slide-type-checklist-for-pitch-decks "Direct link to Slide-type checklist for pitch decks")

A typical banking pitch deck follows this structure. Not prescriptive, but useful as a starting skeleton:

1. Cover / title
2. Disclaimer
3. Table of contents
4. Situation overview
5. Company snapshot (the target)
6. Market / sector context
7. Valuation summary (football field) — the money slide
8. Trading comps detail
9. Precedent transactions detail
10. DCF summary
11. Illustrative LBO / sponsor case
12. Process considerations
13. Appendix

## When NOT to use this skill[​](#when-not-to-use-this-skill "Direct link to When NOT to use this skill")

* Users in a live PowerPoint session with an Office MCP available — drive their live doc instead.
* Non-financial slideware (quarterly all-hands, marketing decks) — use the broader `powerpoint` skill.
* Decks with heavy animation, transitions, or speaker notes — use the broader `powerpoint` skill.

# BlueBubbles (iMessage) | Hermes Agent
**Source:** [https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/bluebubbles](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/bluebubbles)

On this page

Connect Hermes to Apple iMessage via [BlueBubbles](https://bluebubbles.app/) — a free, open-source macOS server that bridges iMessage to any device.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* A **Mac** (always on) running [BlueBubbles Server](https://bluebubbles.app/)
* Apple ID signed into Messages.app on that Mac
* BlueBubbles Server v1.0.0+ (webhooks require this version)
* Network connectivity between Hermes and the BlueBubbles server

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

### 1. Install BlueBubbles Server[​](#1-install-bluebubbles-server "Direct link to 1. Install BlueBubbles Server")

Download and install from [bluebubbles.app](https://bluebubbles.app/). Complete the setup wizard — sign in with your Apple ID and configure a connection method (local network, Ngrok, Cloudflare, or Dynamic DNS).

### 2. Get your Server URL and Password[​](#2-get-your-server-url-and-password "Direct link to 2. Get your Server URL and Password")

In BlueBubbles Server → **Settings → API**, note:

* **Server URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:1234`)
* **Server Password**

### 3. Configure Hermes[​](#3-configure-hermes "Direct link to 3. Configure Hermes")

Run the setup wizard:

```
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **BlueBubbles (iMessage)** and enter your server URL and password.

Or set environment variables directly in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```
BLUEBUBBLES_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.10:1234  
BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD=your-server-password
```

#### Optional: Require mentions in group chats[​](#optional-require-mentions-in-group-chats "Direct link to Optional: Require mentions in group chats")

By default, Hermes responds to every authorized BlueBubbles/iMessage DM or group message. To make group chats opt-in, enable mention gating:

```
platforms:  
  bluebubbles:  
    enabled: true  
    extra:  
      require_mention: true
```

With `require_mention: true`, DMs still work normally, but group-chat messages are ignored unless they match a mention pattern. If you do not configure custom patterns, Hermes uses conservative defaults for `Hermes` and `@Hermes agent` variants.

For a custom agent name, set regex patterns:

```
platforms:  
  bluebubbles:  
    extra:  
      require_mention: true  
      mention_patterns:  
        - '(?<![\w@])@?amos\b[,:\-]?'
```

### 4. Authorize Users[​](#4-authorize-users "Direct link to 4. Authorize Users")

Choose one approach:

**DM Pairing (recommended):**
When someone messages your iMessage, Hermes automatically sends them a pairing code. Approve it with:

```
hermes pairing approve bluebubbles <CODE>
```

Use `hermes pairing list` to see pending codes and approved users.

**Pre-authorize specific users** (in `~/.hermes/.env`):

```
BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOWED_USERS=user@icloud.com,+15551234567
```

**Open access** (in `~/.hermes/.env`):

```
BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true
```

### 5. Start the Gateway[​](#5-start-the-gateway "Direct link to 5. Start the Gateway")

```
hermes gateway run
```

Hermes will connect to your BlueBubbles server, register a webhook, and start listening for iMessage messages.

## How It Works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

```
iMessage → Messages.app → BlueBubbles Server → Webhook → Hermes  
Hermes → BlueBubbles REST API → Messages.app → iMessage
```

* **Inbound:** BlueBubbles sends webhook events to a local listener when new messages arrive. No polling — instant delivery.
* **Outbound:** Hermes sends messages via the BlueBubbles REST API.
* **Media:** Images, voice messages, videos, and documents are supported in both directions. Inbound attachments are downloaded and cached locally for the agent to process.

## Environment Variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_SERVER_URL` | Yes | — | BlueBubbles server URL |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD` | Yes | — | Server password |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_WEBHOOK_HOST` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Webhook listener bind address |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_WEBHOOK_PORT` | No | `8645` | Webhook listener port |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_WEBHOOK_PATH` | No | `/bluebubbles-webhook` | Webhook URL path |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_HOME_CHANNEL` | No | — | Phone/email for cron delivery |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOWED_USERS` | No | — | Comma-separated authorized users |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | No | `false` | Allow all users |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_REQUIRE_MENTION` | No | `false` | Require a mention pattern before responding in group chats |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_MENTION_PATTERNS` | No | Hermes wake words | JSON array, newline-separated, or comma-separated regex patterns for group mention matching |

Auto-marking messages as read is controlled by the `send_read_receipts` key under `platforms.bluebubbles.extra` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (default: `true`). There is no corresponding environment variable.

## Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

### Text Messaging[​](#text-messaging "Direct link to Text Messaging")

Send and receive iMessages. Markdown is automatically stripped for clean plain-text delivery.

### Rich Media[​](#rich-media "Direct link to Rich Media")

* **Images:** Photos appear natively in the iMessage conversation
* **Voice messages:** Audio files sent as iMessage voice messages
* **Videos:** Video attachments
* **Documents:** Files sent as iMessage attachments

### Tapback Reactions[​](#tapback-reactions "Direct link to Tapback Reactions")

Love, like, dislike, laugh, emphasize, and question reactions. Requires the BlueBubbles [Private API helper](https://docs.bluebubbles.app/helper-bundle/installation).

### Typing Indicators[​](#typing-indicators "Direct link to Typing Indicators")

Shows "typing..." in the iMessage conversation while the agent is processing. Requires Private API.

### Read Receipts[​](#read-receipts "Direct link to Read Receipts")

Automatically marks messages as read after processing. Requires Private API.

### Chat Addressing[​](#chat-addressing "Direct link to Chat Addressing")

You can address chats by email or phone number — Hermes resolves them to BlueBubbles chat GUIDs automatically. No need to use raw GUID format.

## Private API[​](#private-api "Direct link to Private API")

Some features require the BlueBubbles [Private API helper](https://docs.bluebubbles.app/helper-bundle/installation):

* Tapback reactions
* Typing indicators
* Read receipts
* Creating new chats by address

Without the Private API, basic text messaging and media still work.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### "Cannot reach server"[​](#cannot-reach-server "Direct link to \"Cannot reach server\"")

* Verify the server URL is correct and the Mac is on
* Check that BlueBubbles Server is running
* Ensure network connectivity (firewall, port forwarding)

### Messages not arriving[​](#messages-not-arriving "Direct link to Messages not arriving")

* Check that the webhook is registered in BlueBubbles Server → Settings → API → Webhooks
* Verify the webhook URL is reachable from the Mac
* Check `hermes logs gateway` for webhook errors (or `hermes logs -f` to follow in real-time)

### "Private API helper not connected"[​](#private-api-helper-not-connected "Direct link to \"Private API helper not connected\"")

* Install the Private API helper: [docs.bluebubbles.app](https://docs.bluebubbles.app/helper-bundle/installation)
* Basic messaging works without it — only reactions, typing, and read receipts require it

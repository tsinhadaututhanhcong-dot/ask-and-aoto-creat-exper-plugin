# Tutorial: Team Telegram Assistant | Hermes Agent
**Source:** [https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/team-telegram-assistant](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/team-telegram-assistant)

On this page

This tutorial walks you through setting up a Telegram bot powered by Hermes Agent that multiple team members can use. By the end, your team will have a shared AI assistant they can message for help with code, research, system administration, and anything else — secured with per-user authorization.

## What We're Building[​](#what-were-building "Direct link to What We're Building")

A Telegram bot that:

* **Any authorized team member** can DM for help — code reviews, research, shell commands, debugging
* **Runs on your server** with full tool access — terminal, file editing, web search, code execution
* **Per-user sessions** — each person gets their own conversation context
* **Secure by default** — only approved users can interact, with two authorization methods
* **Scheduled tasks** — daily standups, health checks, and reminders delivered to a team channel

---

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before starting, make sure you have:

* **Hermes Agent installed** on a server or VPS (not your laptop — the bot needs to stay running). Follow the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) if you haven't yet.
* **A Telegram account** for yourself (the bot owner)
* **An LLM provider configured** — at minimum, an API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or another supported provider in `~/.hermes/.env`

tip

A $5/month VPS is plenty for running the gateway. Hermes itself is lightweight — the LLM API calls are what cost money, and those happen remotely.

---

## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot[​](#step-1-create-a-telegram-bot "Direct link to Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot")

Every Telegram bot starts with **@BotFather** — Telegram's official bot for creating bots.

1. **Open Telegram** and search for `@BotFather`, or go to [t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. **Send `/newbot`** — BotFather will ask you two things:

   * **Display name** — what users see (e.g., `Team Hermes Assistant`)
   * **Username** — must end in `bot` (e.g., `myteam_hermes_bot`)
3. **Copy the bot token** — BotFather replies with something like:

   ```
   Use this token to access the HTTP API:  
   7123456789:AAH1bGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp...
   ```

   Save this token — you'll need it in the next step.
4. **Set a description** (optional but recommended):

   ```
   /setdescription
   ```

   Choose your bot, then enter something like:

   ```
   Team AI assistant powered by Hermes Agent. DM me for help with code, research, debugging, and more.
   ```
5. **Set bot commands** (optional — gives users a command menu):

   ```
   /setcommands
   ```

   Choose your bot, then paste:

   ```
   new - Start a fresh conversation  
   model - Show or change the AI model  
   status - Show session info  
   help - Show available commands  
   stop - Stop the current task
   ```

warning

Keep your bot token secret. Anyone with the token can control the bot. If it leaks, use `/revoke` in BotFather to generate a new one.

---

## Step 2: Configure the Gateway[​](#step-2-configure-the-gateway "Direct link to Step 2: Configure the Gateway")

You have two options: the interactive setup wizard (recommended) or manual configuration.

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)[​](#option-a-interactive-setup-recommended "Direct link to Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)")

```
hermes gateway setup
```

This walks you through everything with arrow-key selection. Pick **Telegram**, paste your bot token, and enter your user ID when prompted.

### Option B: Manual Configuration[​](#option-b-manual-configuration "Direct link to Option B: Manual Configuration")

Add these lines to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```
# Telegram bot token from BotFather  
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7123456789:AAH1bGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp...  
  
# Your Telegram user ID (numeric)  
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789
```

### Finding Your User ID[​](#finding-your-user-id "Direct link to Finding Your User ID")

Your Telegram user ID is a numeric value (not your username). To find it:

1. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. It instantly replies with your numeric user ID
3. Copy that number into `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`

info

Telegram user IDs are permanent numbers like `123456789`. They're different from your `@username`, which can change. Always use the numeric ID for allowlists.

---

## Step 3: Start the Gateway[​](#step-3-start-the-gateway "Direct link to Step 3: Start the Gateway")

### Quick Test[​](#quick-test "Direct link to Quick Test")

Run the gateway in the foreground first to make sure everything works:

```
hermes gateway
```

You should see output like:

```
[Gateway] Starting Hermes Gateway...  
[Gateway] Telegram adapter connected  
[Gateway] Cron scheduler started (tick every 60s)
```

Open Telegram, find your bot, and send it a message. If it replies, you're in business. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### Production: Install as a Service[​](#production-install-as-a-service "Direct link to Production: Install as a Service")

For a persistent deployment that survives reboots:

```
hermes gateway install  
sudo hermes gateway install --system   # Linux only: boot-time system service
```

This creates a background service: a user-level **systemd** service on Linux by default, a **launchd** service on macOS, or a boot-time Linux system service if you pass `--system`.

```
# Linux — manage the default user service  
hermes gateway start  
hermes gateway stop  
hermes gateway status  
  
# View live logs  
journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway -f  
  
# Keep running after SSH logout  
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER  
  
# Linux servers — explicit system-service commands  
sudo hermes gateway start --system  
sudo hermes gateway status --system  
journalctl -u hermes-gateway -f
```

```
# macOS — manage the service  
hermes gateway start  
hermes gateway stop  
tail -f ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log
```

macOS PATH

The launchd plist captures your shell PATH at install time so gateway subprocesses can find tools like Node.js and ffmpeg. If you install new tools later, re-run `hermes gateway install` to update the plist.

### Verify It's Running[​](#verify-its-running "Direct link to Verify It's Running")

```
hermes gateway status
```

Then send a test message to your bot on Telegram. You should get a response within a few seconds.

---

## Step 4: Set Up Team Access[​](#step-4-set-up-team-access "Direct link to Step 4: Set Up Team Access")

Now let's give your teammates access. There are two approaches.

### Approach A: Static Allowlist[​](#approach-a-static-allowlist "Direct link to Approach A: Static Allowlist")

Collect each team member's Telegram user ID (have them message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)) and add them as a comma-separated list:

```
# In ~/.hermes/.env  
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321,555555555
```

Restart the gateway after changes:

```
hermes gateway stop && hermes gateway start
```

### Approach B: DM Pairing (Recommended for Teams)[​](#approach-b-dm-pairing-recommended-for-teams "Direct link to Approach B: DM Pairing (Recommended for Teams)")

DM pairing is more flexible — you don't need to collect user IDs upfront. Here's how it works:

1. **Teammate DMs the bot** — since they're not on the allowlist, the bot replies with a one-time pairing code:

   ```
   🔐 Pairing code: XKGH5N7P  
   Send this code to the bot owner for approval.
   ```
2. **Teammate sends you the code** (via any channel — Slack, email, in person)
3. **You approve it** on the server:

   ```
   hermes pairing approve telegram XKGH5N7P
   ```
4. **They're in** — the bot immediately starts responding to their messages

**Managing paired users:**

```
# See all pending and approved users  
hermes pairing list  
  
# Revoke someone's access  
hermes pairing revoke telegram 987654321  
  
# Clear expired pending codes  
hermes pairing clear-pending
```

tip

DM pairing is ideal for teams because you don't need to restart the gateway when adding new users. Approvals take effect immediately.

### Security Considerations[​](#security-considerations "Direct link to Security Considerations")

* **Never set `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`** on a bot with terminal access — anyone who finds your bot could run commands on your server
* Pairing codes expire after **1 hour** and use cryptographic randomness
* Rate limiting prevents brute-force attacks: 1 request per user per 10 minutes, max 3 pending codes per platform
* After 5 failed approval attempts, the platform enters a 1-hour lockout
* All pairing data is stored with `chmod 0600` permissions

---

## Step 5: Configure the Bot[​](#step-5-configure-the-bot "Direct link to Step 5: Configure the Bot")

### Set a Home Channel[​](#set-a-home-channel "Direct link to Set a Home Channel")

A **home channel** is where the bot delivers cron job results and proactive messages. Without one, scheduled tasks have nowhere to send output.

**Option 1:** Use the `/sethome` command in any Telegram group or chat where the bot is a member.

**Option 2:** Set it manually in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL=-1001234567890  
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME="Team Updates"
```

To find a channel ID, add [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to the group — it will report the group's chat ID.

### Configure Tool Progress Display[​](#configure-tool-progress-display "Direct link to Configure Tool Progress Display")

Control how much detail the bot shows when using tools. In `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```
display:  
  tool_progress: new    # off | new | all | verbose
```

| Mode | What You See |
| --- | --- |
| `off` | Clean responses only — no tool activity |
| `new` | Brief status for each new tool call (recommended for messaging) |
| `all` | Every tool call with details |
| `verbose` | Full tool output including command results |

Users can also change this per-session with the `/verbose` command in chat.

### Set Up a Personality with SOUL.md[​](#set-up-a-personality-with-soulmd "Direct link to Set Up a Personality with SOUL.md")

Customize how the bot communicates by editing `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`:

For a full guide, see [Use SOUL.md with Hermes](/docs/guides/use-soul-with-hermes).

```
# Soul  
You are a helpful team assistant. Be concise and technical.  
Use code blocks for any code. Skip pleasantries — the team  
values directness. When debugging, always ask for error logs  
before guessing at solutions.
```

### Add Project Context[​](#add-project-context "Direct link to Add Project Context")

If your team works on specific projects, create context files so the bot knows your stack:

```
<!-- ~/.hermes/AGENTS.md -->  
# Team Context  
- We use Python 3.12 with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy  
- Frontend is React with TypeScript  
- CI/CD runs on GitHub Actions  
- Production deploys to AWS ECS  
- Always suggest writing tests for new code
```

info

Context files are injected into every session's system prompt. Keep them concise — every character counts against your token budget.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Scheduled Tasks[​](#step-6-set-up-scheduled-tasks "Direct link to Step 6: Set Up Scheduled Tasks")

With the gateway running, you can schedule recurring tasks that deliver results to your team channel.

### Daily Standup Summary[​](#daily-standup-summary "Direct link to Daily Standup Summary")

Message the bot on Telegram:

```
Every weekday at 9am, check the GitHub repository at  
github.com/myorg/myproject for:  
1. Pull requests opened/merged in the last 24 hours  
2. Issues created or closed  
3. Any CI/CD failures on the main branch  
Format as a brief standup-style summary.
```

The agent creates a cron job automatically and delivers results to the chat where you asked (or the home channel).

### Server Health Check[​](#server-health-check "Direct link to Server Health Check")

```
Every 6 hours, check disk usage with 'df -h', memory with 'free -h',  
and Docker container status with 'docker ps'. Report anything unusual —  
partitions above 80%, containers that have restarted, or high memory usage.
```

### Managing Scheduled Tasks[​](#managing-scheduled-tasks "Direct link to Managing Scheduled Tasks")

```
# From the CLI  
hermes cron list          # View all scheduled jobs  
hermes cron status        # Check if scheduler is running  
  
# From Telegram chat  
/cron list                # View jobs  
/cron remove <job_id>     # Remove a job
```

warning

Cron job prompts run in completely fresh sessions with no memory of prior conversations. Make sure each prompt contains **all** the context the agent needs — file paths, URLs, server addresses, and clear instructions.

## Production Tips[​](#production-tips "Direct link to Production Tips")

### Use Docker for Safety[​](#use-docker-for-safety "Direct link to Use Docker for Safety")

On a shared team bot, use Docker as the terminal backend so agent commands run in a container instead of on your host:

```
# In ~/.hermes/.env  
TERMINAL_BACKEND=docker  
TERMINAL_DOCKER_IMAGE=nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.11-nodejs20
```

Or in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```
terminal:  
  backend: docker  
  container_cpu: 1  
  container_memory: 5120  
  container_persistent: true
```

This way, even if someone asks the bot to run something destructive, your host system is protected.

### Monitor the Gateway[​](#monitor-the-gateway "Direct link to Monitor the Gateway")

```
# Check if the gateway is running  
hermes gateway status  
  
# Watch live logs (Linux)  
journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway -f  
  
# Watch live logs (macOS)  
tail -f ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log
```

### Keep Hermes Updated[​](#keep-hermes-updated "Direct link to Keep Hermes Updated")

From Telegram, send `/update` to the bot — it will pull the latest version and restart. Or from the server:

```
hermes update  
hermes gateway stop && hermes gateway start
```

### Log Locations[​](#log-locations "Direct link to Log Locations")

| What | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Gateway logs | `journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway` (Linux) or `~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log` (macOS) |
| Cron job output | `~/.hermes/cron/output/{job_id}/{timestamp}.md` |
| Cron job definitions | `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json` |
| Pairing data | `~/.hermes/pairing/` |
| Session history | `~/.hermes/sessions/` |

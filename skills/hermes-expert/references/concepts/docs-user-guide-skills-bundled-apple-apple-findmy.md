The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.

# Find My (Apple)

Track Apple devices and AirTags via the FindMy.app on macOS. Since Apple doesn't
provide a CLI for FindMy, this skill uses AppleScript to open the app and
screen capture to read device locations.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* **macOS** with Find My app and iCloud signed in
* Devices/AirTags already registered in Find My
* Screen Recording permission for terminal (System Settings → Privacy → Screen Recording)
* **Optional but recommended**: Install `peekaboo` for better UI automation:
  `brew install steipete/tap/peekaboo`

## When to Use[​](#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")

* User asks "where is my [device/cat/keys/bag]?"
* Tracking AirTag locations
* Checking device locations (iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods)
* Monitoring pet or item movement over time (AirTag patrol routes)

## Method 1: AppleScript + Screenshot (Basic)[​](#method-1-applescript--screenshot-basic "Direct link to Method 1: AppleScript + Screenshot (Basic)")

### Open FindMy and Navigate[​](#open-findmy-and-navigate "Direct link to Open FindMy and Navigate")

```
# Open Find My app  
osascript -e 'tell application "FindMy" to activate'  
  
# Wait for it to load  
sleep 3  
  
# Take a screenshot of the Find My window  
screencapture -w -o /tmp/findmy.png
```

Then use `vision_analyze` to read the screenshot:

```
vision_analyze(image_url="/tmp/findmy.png", question="What devices/items are shown and what are their locations?")
```

### Switch Between Tabs[​](#switch-between-tabs "Direct link to Switch Between Tabs")

```
# Switch to Devices tab  
osascript -e '  
tell application "System Events"  
    tell process "FindMy"  
        click button "Devices" of toolbar 1 of window 1  
    end tell  
end tell'  
  
# Switch to Items tab (AirTags)  
osascript -e '  
tell application "System Events"  
    tell process "FindMy"  
        click button "Items" of toolbar 1 of window 1  
    end tell  
end tell'
```

## Method 2: Peekaboo UI Automation (Recommended)[​](#method-2-peekaboo-ui-automation-recommended "Direct link to Method 2: Peekaboo UI Automation (Recommended)")

If `peekaboo` is installed, use it for more reliable UI interaction:

```
# Open Find My  
osascript -e 'tell application "FindMy" to activate'  
sleep 3  
  
# Capture and annotate the UI  
peekaboo see --app "FindMy" --annotate --path /tmp/findmy-ui.png  
  
# Click on a specific device/item by element ID  
peekaboo click --on B3 --app "FindMy"  
  
# Capture the detail view  
peekaboo image --app "FindMy" --path /tmp/findmy-detail.png
```

Then analyze with vision:

```
vision_analyze(image_url="/tmp/findmy-detail.png", question="What is the location shown for this device/item? Include address and coordinates if visible.")
```

## Workflow: Track AirTag Location Over Time[​](#workflow-track-airtag-location-over-time "Direct link to Workflow: Track AirTag Location Over Time")

For monitoring an AirTag (e.g., tracking a cat's patrol route):

```
# 1. Open FindMy to Items tab  
osascript -e 'tell application "FindMy" to activate'  
sleep 3  
  
# 2. Click on the AirTag item (stay on page — AirTag only updates when page is open)  
  
# 3. Periodically capture location  
while true; do  
    screencapture -w -o /tmp/findmy-$(date +%H%M%S).png  
    sleep 300  # Every 5 minutes  
done
```

Analyze each screenshot with vision to extract coordinates, then compile a route.

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

* FindMy has **no CLI or API** — must use UI automation
* AirTags only update location while the FindMy page is actively displayed
* Location accuracy depends on nearby Apple devices in the FindMy network
* Screen Recording permission required for screenshots
* AppleScript UI automation may break across macOS versions

## Rules[​](#rules "Direct link to Rules")

1. Keep FindMy app in the foreground when tracking AirTags (updates stop when minimized)
2. Use `vision_analyze` to read screenshot content — don't try to parse pixels
3. For ongoing tracking, use a cronjob to periodically capture and log locations
4. Respect privacy — only track devices/items the user owns

# Architecture Diagram Skill

Generate professional, dark-themed technical architecture diagrams as standalone HTML files with inline SVG graphics. No external tools, no API keys, no rendering libraries — just write the HTML file and open it in a browser.

## Scope[​](#scope "Direct link to Scope")

**Best suited for:**

* Software system architecture (frontend / backend / database layers)
* Cloud infrastructure (VPC, regions, subnets, managed services)
* Microservice / service-mesh topology
* Database + API map, deployment diagrams
* Anything with a tech-infra subject that fits a dark, grid-backed aesthetic

**Look elsewhere first for:**

* Physics, chemistry, math, biology, or other scientific subjects
* Physical objects (vehicles, hardware, anatomy, cross-sections)
* Floor plans, narrative journeys, educational / textbook-style visuals
* Hand-drawn whiteboard sketches (consider `excalidraw`)
* Animated explainers (consider an animation skill)

If a more specialized skill is available for the subject, prefer that. If none fits, this skill can also serve as a general SVG diagram fallback — the output will just carry the dark tech aesthetic described below.

Based on [Cocoon AI's architecture-diagram-generator](https://github.com/Cocoon-AI/architecture-diagram-generator) (MIT).

## Workflow[​](#workflow "Direct link to Workflow")

1. User describes their system architecture (components, connections, technologies)
2. Generate the HTML file following the design system below
3. Save with `write_file` to a `.html` file (e.g. `~/architecture-diagram.html`)
4. User opens in any browser — works offline, no dependencies

### Output Location[​](#output-location "Direct link to Output Location")

Save diagrams to a user-specified path, or default to the current working directory:

```
./[project-name]-architecture.html
```

### Preview[​](#preview "Direct link to Preview")

After saving, suggest the user open it:

```
# macOS  
open ./my-architecture.html  
# Linux  
xdg-open ./my-architecture.html
```

## Design System & Visual Language[​](#design-system--visual-language "Direct link to Design System & Visual Language")

### Color Palette (Semantic Mapping)[​](#color-palette-semantic-mapping "Direct link to Color Palette (Semantic Mapping)")

Use specific `rgba` fills and hex strokes to categorize components:

| Component Type | Fill (rgba) | Stroke (Hex) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | `rgba(8, 51, 68, 0.4)` | `#22d3ee` (cyan-400) |
| **Backend** | `rgba(6, 78, 59, 0.4)` | `#34d399` (emerald-400) |
| **Database** | `rgba(76, 29, 149, 0.4)` | `#a78bfa` (violet-400) |
| **AWS/Cloud** | `rgba(120, 53, 15, 0.3)` | `#fbbf24` (amber-400) |
| **Security** | `rgba(136, 19, 55, 0.4)` | `#fb7185` (rose-400) |
| **Message Bus** | `rgba(251, 146, 60, 0.3)` | `#fb923c` (orange-400) |
| **External** | `rgba(30, 41, 59, 0.5)` | `#94a3b8` (slate-400) |

### Typography & Background[​](#typography--background "Direct link to Typography & Background")

* **Font:** JetBrains Mono (Monospace), loaded from Google Fonts
* **Sizes:** 12px (Names), 9px (Sublabels), 8px (Annotations), 7px (Tiny labels)
* **Background:** Slate-950 (`#020617`) with a subtle 40px grid pattern

```
<!-- Background Grid Pattern -->  
<pattern id="grid" width="40" height="40" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">  
  <path d="M 40 0 L 0 0 0 40" fill="none" stroke="#1e293b" stroke-width="0.5"/>  
</pattern>
```

## Technical Implementation Details[​](#technical-implementation-details "Direct link to Technical Implementation Details")

### Component Rendering[​](#component-rendering "Direct link to Component Rendering")

Components are rounded rectangles (`rx="6"`) with 1.5px strokes. To prevent arrows from showing through semi-transparent fills, use a **double-rect masking technique**:

1. Draw an opaque background rect (`#0f172a`)
2. Draw the semi-transparent styled rect on top

### Connection Rules[​](#connection-rules "Direct link to Connection Rules")

* **Z-Order:** Draw arrows *early* in the SVG (after the grid) so they render behind component boxes
* **Arrowheads:** Defined via SVG markers
* **Security Flows:** Use dashed lines in rose color (`#fb7185`)
* **Boundaries:**
  + *Security Groups:* Dashed (`4,4`), rose color
  + *Regions:* Large dashed (`8,4`), amber color, `rx="12"`

### Spacing & Layout Logic[​](#spacing--layout-logic "Direct link to Spacing & Layout Logic")

* **Standard Height:** 60px (Services); 80-120px (Large components)
* **Vertical Gap:** Minimum 40px between components
* **Message Buses:** Must be placed *in the gap* between services, not overlapping them
* **Legend Placement:** **CRITICAL.** Must be placed outside all boundary boxes. Calculate the lowest Y-coordinate of all boundaries and place the legend at least 20px below it.

## Document Structure[​](#document-structure "Direct link to Document Structure")

The generated HTML file follows a four-part layout:

1. **Header:** Title with a pulsing dot indicator and subtitle
2. **Main SVG:** The diagram contained within a rounded border card
3. **Summary Cards:** A grid of three cards below the diagram for high-level details
4. **Footer:** Minimal metadata

### Info Card Pattern[​](#info-card-pattern "Direct link to Info Card Pattern")

```
<div class="card">  
  <div class="card-header">  
    <div class="card-dot cyan"></div>  
    <h3>Title</h3>  
  </div>  
  <ul>  
    <li>• Item one</li>  
    <li>• Item two</li>  
  </ul>  
</div>
```

## Output Requirements[​](#output-requirements "Direct link to Output Requirements")

* **Single File:** One self-contained `.html` file
* **No External Dependencies:** All CSS and SVG must be inline (except Google Fonts)
* **No JavaScript:** Use pure CSS for any animations (like pulsing dots)
* **Compatibility:** Must render correctly in any modern web browser

## Template Reference[​](#template-reference "Direct link to Template Reference")

Load the full HTML template for the exact structure, CSS, and SVG component examples:

```
skill_view(name="architecture-diagram", file_path="templates/template.html")
```

The template contains working examples of every component type (frontend, backend, database, cloud, security), arrow styles (standard, dashed, curved), security groups, region boundaries, and the legend — use it as your structural reference when generating diagrams.

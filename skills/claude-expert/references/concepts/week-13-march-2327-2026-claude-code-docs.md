Auto moderesearch preview

Auto mode hands your permission prompts to a classifier. Safe edits and commands run without interrupting you; anything destructive or suspicious gets blocked and surfaced. It’s the middle ground between approving every file write and running with `—dangerously-skip-permissions`.

Cycle to auto with Shift+Tab, or set it as your default:

~/.claude/settings.json

```
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "auto"
  }
}
```

Computer useDesktop

Claude can now control your actual desktop from the Claude Code Desktop app: open native apps, click through the iOS simulator, drive hardware control panels, and verify changes on screen. It’s off by default and asks before each action. Best for the things nothing else can reach: apps without an API, proprietary tools, anything that only exists as a GUI.

![Claude Desktop settings with the Computer use toggle enabled, showing the option to let Claude take screenshots and control your keyboard and mouse in apps you allow](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/CfffsX01JHFnIKvD/images/whats-new/computer-use.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=CfffsX01JHFnIKvD&q=85&s=d631de2017edafff463505f8ddbc0f51)

Enable it in Settings, grant the OS permissions, then ask Claude to verify a change end to end:

Claude Code

```
> Open the iOS simulator, tap through the onboarding flow, and screenshot each step
```

PR auto-fixWeb

Flip a switch when you open a PR and walk away. Claude watches CI, fixes the failures, handles the nits, and pushes until it’s green. No more babysitting a PR through six rounds of lint errors.

After creating a PR on Claude Code web, toggle Auto fix in the CI panel.

Transcript searchv2.1.83

Press `/` in transcript mode to search your conversation. `n` and `N` step through matches. Finally a way to find that one Bash command Claude ran 400 messages ago.

Open transcript mode and search:

Claude Code

```
Ctrl+O    # open transcript
/migrate  # search for "migrate"
n         # next match
N         # previous match
```

PowerShell toolpreviewv2.1.84

Windows gets a native PowerShell tool alongside Bash. Claude can run cmdlets, pipe objects, and work with Windows-native paths without translating everything through Git Bash.

Opt in from settings:

.claude/settings.json

```
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL": "1"
  }
}
```

Conditional hooksv2.1.85

Hooks can now declare an `if` field using permission rule syntax. Your pre-commit check only spawns for `Bash(git commit *)` instead of every bash call, cutting the process overhead on busy sessions.

Scope a hook to git commits only:

.claude/settings.json

```
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "if": "Bash(git commit *)",
        "type": "command",
        "command": ".claude/hooks/lint-staged.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

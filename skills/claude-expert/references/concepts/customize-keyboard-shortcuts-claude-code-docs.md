# Customize keyboard shortcuts - Claude Code Docs
**Source:** [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings)

Customizable keyboard shortcuts require Claude Code v2.1.18 or later. Check your version with `claude --version`.

Claude Code supports customizable keyboard shortcuts. Run `/keybindings` to create or open your configuration file at `~/.claude/keybindings.json`.

## [​](#configuration-file) Configuration file

The keybindings configuration file is an object with a `bindings` array. Each block specifies a context and a map of keystrokes to actions.

Changes to the keybindings file are automatically detected and applied without restarting Claude Code.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$schema` | Optional JSON Schema URL for editor autocompletion |
| `$docs` | Optional documentation URL |
| `bindings` | Array of binding blocks by context |

This example binds `Ctrl+E` to open an external editor in the chat context, and unbinds `Ctrl+U`:

```
{
  "$schema": "https://www.schemastore.org/claude-code-keybindings.json",
  "$docs": "https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "context": "Chat",
      "bindings": {
        "ctrl+e": "chat:externalEditor",
        "ctrl+u": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## [​](#contexts) Contexts

Each binding block specifies a **context** where the bindings apply:

| Context | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Global` | Applies everywhere in the app |
| `Chat` | Main chat input area |
| `Autocomplete` | Autocomplete menu is open |
| `Settings` | Settings menu |

| `Task` | Background task is running |
| `ThemePicker` | Theme picker dialog |
| `Attachments` | Image attachment navigation in select dialogs |
| `Footer` | Footer indicator navigation (tasks, teams, diff) |
| `MessageSelector` | Rewind and summarize dialog message selection |
| `DiffDialog` | Diff viewer navigation |
| `ModelPicker` | Model picker effort level |
| `Select` | Generic select/list components |
| `Plugin` | Plugin dialog (browse, discover, manage) |
| `Scroll` | Conversation scrolling and text selection in fullscreen mode |
| `Doctor` | `/doctor` diagnostics screen |

## [​](#available-actions) Available actions

Actions available in the `Settings` context. The `select:accept` and `confirm:no` actions are reused from the [Select](#select-actions) and [Confirmation](#confirmation-actions) contexts with Settings-specific behavior: changes apply to each setting as soon as you change it, so Escape closes the panel with your changes saved rather than declining.

## [​](#keystroke-syntax) Keystroke syntax

### [​](#modifiers) Modifiers

Use modifier keys with the `+` separator:

* `ctrl` or `control` - Control key
* `shift` - Shift key
* `alt`, `opt`, `option`, or `meta` - Alt key on Windows and Linux, Option key on macOS
* `cmd`, `command`, `super`, or `win` - Command key on macOS, Windows key on Windows, Super key on Linux

The `cmd` group is only detected in terminals that report the Super modifier, such as those supporting the Kitty keyboard protocol or xterm’s `modifyOtherKeys` mode. Most terminals do not send it, so use `ctrl` or `meta` for bindings you want to work everywhere.
For example:

```
ctrl+k          Ctrl + K
shift+tab       Shift + Tab
meta+p          Option + P on macOS, Alt + P elsewhere
ctrl+shift+c    Multiple modifiers
```

### [​](#uppercase-letters) Uppercase letters

A standalone uppercase letter implies Shift. For example, `K` is equivalent to `shift+k`. This is useful for vim-style bindings where uppercase and lowercase keys have different meanings.
Uppercase letters with modifiers (e.g., `ctrl+K`) are treated as stylistic and do **not** imply Shift: `ctrl+K` is the same as `ctrl+k`.

### [​](#chords) Chords

Chords are sequences of keystrokes separated by spaces:

```
ctrl+k ctrl+s   Press Ctrl+K, release, then Ctrl+S
```

### [​](#special-keys) Special keys

* `escape` or `esc` - Escape key
* `enter` or `return` - Enter key
* `tab` - Tab key
* `space` - Space bar
* `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` - Arrow keys
* `backspace`, `delete` - Delete keys

## [​](#unbind-default-shortcuts) Unbind default shortcuts

Set an action to `null` to unbind a default shortcut:

```
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "context": "Chat",
      "bindings": {
        "ctrl+s": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This also works for chord bindings. Unbinding every chord that shares a prefix frees that prefix for use as a single-key binding:

```
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "context": "Chat",
      "bindings": {
        "ctrl+x ctrl+k": null,
        "ctrl+x ctrl+e": null,
        "ctrl+x": "chat:newline"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If you unbind some but not all chords on a prefix, pressing the prefix still enters chord-wait mode for the remaining bindings.

## [​](#reserved-shortcuts) Reserved shortcuts

These shortcuts cannot be rebound:

| Shortcut | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+C | Hardcoded interrupt/cancel |
| Ctrl+D | Hardcoded exit |
| Ctrl+M | Identical to Enter in terminals (both send CR) |
| Caps Lock | Not delivered to terminal applications |

## [​](#terminal-conflicts) Terminal conflicts

Some shortcuts may conflict with terminal multiplexers:

| Shortcut | Conflict |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+B | tmux prefix (press twice to send) |
| Ctrl+A | GNU screen prefix |
| Ctrl+Z | Unix process suspend (SIGTSTP) |

## [​](#vim-mode-interaction) Vim mode interaction

When vim mode is enabled via `/config` → Editor mode, keybindings and vim mode operate independently:

* **Vim mode** handles input at the text input level (cursor movement, modes, motions)
* **Keybindings** handle actions at the component level (toggle todos, submit, etc.)
* The Escape key in vim mode switches INSERT to NORMAL mode; it does not trigger `chat:cancel`
* Most Ctrl+key shortcuts pass through vim mode to the keybinding system
* In vim NORMAL mode, `?` shows the help menu (vim behavior)
* In vim NORMAL mode, `/` opens history search, the same as Ctrl+R in standard mode

## [​](#validation) Validation

Claude Code validates your keybindings and shows warnings for:

* Parse errors (invalid JSON or structure)
* Invalid context names
* Reserved shortcut conflicts
* Terminal multiplexer conflicts
* Duplicate bindings in the same context

Run `/doctor` to see any keybinding warnings.

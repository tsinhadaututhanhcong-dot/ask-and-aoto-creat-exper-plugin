# Rewind file changes with checkpointing - Claude Code Docs
**Source:** [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/file-checkpointing](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/file-checkpointing)

File checkpointing tracks file modifications made through the Write, Edit, and NotebookEdit tools during an agent session, allowing you to rewind files to any previous state. Want to try it out? Jump to the [interactive example](#try-it-out).
With checkpointing, you can:

* **Undo unwanted changes** by restoring files to a known good state
* **Explore alternatives** by restoring to a checkpoint and trying a different approach
* **Recover from errors** when the agent makes incorrect modifications

Only changes made through the Write, Edit, and NotebookEdit tools are tracked. Changes made through Bash commands (like `echo > file.txt` or `sed -i`) are not captured by the checkpoint system.

## [​](#how-checkpointing-works) How checkpointing works

When you enable file checkpointing, the SDK creates backups of files before modifying them through the Write, Edit, or NotebookEdit tools. User messages in the response stream include a checkpoint UUID that you can use as a restore point.
Checkpoint works with these built-in tools that the agent uses to modify files:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Write | Creates a new file or overwrites an existing file with new content |
| Edit | Makes targeted edits to specific parts of an existing file |
| NotebookEdit | Modifies cells in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) |

File rewinding restores files on disk to a previous state. It does not rewind the conversation itself. The conversation history and context remain intact after calling `rewindFiles()` (TypeScript) or `rewind_files()` (Python).

The checkpoint system tracks:

* Files created during the session
* Files modified during the session
* The original content of modified files

When you rewind to a checkpoint, created files are deleted and modified files are restored to their content at that point.

## [​](#implement-checkpointing) Implement checkpointing

To use file checkpointing, enable it in your options, capture checkpoint UUIDs from the response stream, then call `rewindFiles()` (TypeScript) or `rewind_files()` (Python) when you need to restore.
The following example shows the complete flow: enable checkpointing, capture the checkpoint UUID and session ID from the response stream, then resume the session later to rewind files. Each step is explained in detail below.

Python

TypeScript

```
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    ClaudeSDKClient,
    ClaudeAgentOptions,
    UserMessage,
    ResultMessage,
)


async def main():
    # Step 1: Enable checkpointing
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        enable_file_checkpointing=True,
        permission_mode="acceptEdits",  # Auto-accept file edits without prompting
        extra_args={
            "replay-user-messages": None
        },  # Required to receive checkpoint UUIDs in the response stream
    )

    checkpoint_id = None
    session_id = None

    # Run the query and capture checkpoint UUID and session ID
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:
        await client.query("Refactor the authentication module")

        # Step 2: Capture checkpoint UUID from the first user message
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, UserMessage) and message.uuid and not checkpoint_id:
                checkpoint_id = message.uuid
            if isinstance(message, ResultMessage) and not session_id:
                session_id = message.session_id

    # Step 3: Later, rewind by resuming the session with an empty prompt
    if checkpoint_id and session_id:
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(
            ClaudeAgentOptions(enable_file_checkpointing=True, resume=session_id)
        ) as client:
            await client.query("")  # Empty prompt to open the connection
            async for message in client.receive_response():
                await client.rewind_files(checkpoint_id)
                break
        print(f"Rewound to checkpoint: {checkpoint_id}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

Enable checkpointing

Configure your SDK options to enable checkpointing and receive checkpoint UUIDs:

| Option | Python | TypeScript | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable checkpointing | `enable_file_checkpointing=True` | `enableFileCheckpointing: true` | Tracks file changes for rewinding |
| Receive checkpoint UUIDs | `extra_args={"replay-user-messages": None}` | `extraArgs: { 'replay-user-messages': null }` | Required to get user message UUIDs in the stream |

Python

TypeScript

```
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    enable_file_checkpointing=True,
    permission_mode="acceptEdits",
    extra_args={"replay-user-messages": None},
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:
    await client.query("Refactor the authentication module")
```

2

Capture checkpoint UUID and session ID

With the `replay-user-messages` option set (shown above), each user message in the response stream has a UUID that serves as a checkpoint.For most use cases, capture the first user message UUID (`message.uuid`); rewinding to it restores all files to their original state. To store multiple checkpoints and rewind to intermediate states, see [Multiple restore points](#multiple-restore-points).Capturing the session ID (`message.session_id`) is optional; you only need it if you want to rewind later, after the stream completes. If you’re calling `rewindFiles()` immediately while still processing messages (as the example in [Checkpoint before risky operations](#checkpoint-before-risky-operations) does), you can skip capturing the session ID.

Python

TypeScript

```
checkpoint_id = None
session_id = None

async for message in client.receive_response():
    # Update checkpoint on each user message (keeps the latest)
    if isinstance(message, UserMessage) and message.uuid:
        checkpoint_id = message.uuid
    # Capture session ID from the result message
    if isinstance(message, ResultMessage):
        session_id = message.session_id
```

Rewind files

To rewind after the stream completes, resume the session with an empty prompt and call `rewind_files()` (Python) or `rewindFiles()` (TypeScript) with your checkpoint UUID. You can also rewind during the stream; see [Checkpoint before risky operations](#checkpoint-before-risky-operations) for that pattern.

Python

TypeScript

```
async with ClaudeSDKClient(
    ClaudeAgentOptions(enable_file_checkpointing=True, resume=session_id)
) as client:
    await client.query("")  # Empty prompt to open the connection
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        await client.rewind_files(checkpoint_id)
        break
```

If you capture the session ID and checkpoint ID, you can also rewind from the CLI:

```
claude -p --resume <session-id> --rewind-files <checkpoint-uuid>
```

## [​](#common-patterns) Common patterns

These patterns show different ways to capture and use checkpoint UUIDs depending on your use case.

### [​](#checkpoint-before-risky-operations) Checkpoint before risky operations

This pattern keeps only the most recent checkpoint UUID, updating it before each agent turn. If something goes wrong during processing, you can immediately rewind to the last safe state and break out of the loop.

Python

TypeScript

```
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions, UserMessage


async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        enable_file_checkpointing=True,
        permission_mode="acceptEdits",
        extra_args={"replay-user-messages": None},
    )

    safe_checkpoint = None

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:
        await client.query("Refactor the authentication module")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            # Update checkpoint before each agent turn starts
            # This overwrites the previous checkpoint. Only keep the latest
            if isinstance(message, UserMessage) and message.uuid:
                safe_checkpoint = message.uuid

            # Decide when to revert based on your own logic
            # For example: error detection, validation failure, or user input
            if your_revert_condition and safe_checkpoint:
                await client.rewind_files(safe_checkpoint)
                # Exit the loop after rewinding, files are restored
                break


asyncio.run(main())
```

### [​](#multiple-restore-points) Multiple restore points

If Claude makes changes across multiple turns, you might want to rewind to a specific point rather than all the way back. For example, if Claude refactors a file in turn one and adds tests in turn two, you might want to keep the refactor but undo the tests.
This pattern stores all checkpoint UUIDs in an array with metadata. After the session completes, you can rewind to any previous checkpoint:

Python

TypeScript

```
import asyncio
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    ClaudeSDKClient,
    ClaudeAgentOptions,
    UserMessage,
    ResultMessage,
)

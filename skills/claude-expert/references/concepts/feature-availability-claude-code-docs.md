# Feature availability - Claude Code Docs
**Source:** [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/feature-availability](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/feature-availability)

The Claude Code CLI and everything that runs locally work identically on every provider. For setup instructions per provider, see the [Enterprise deployment overview](/docs/en/third-party-integrations). To skip straight to what is missing on your provider, see the [summary by provider](#summary-by-provider) tabs.
In the tables below, ✓ means available, ✗ means not available, and “See note” links to a footnote for partial support. A qualifier after ✓ narrows availability to that subset, and “Admin-enabled” means the feature is off until an organization admin turns it on.

## [​](#availability-by-model-provider) Availability by model provider

How you authenticate determines which features Claude Code can reach. For a single list of what is missing on your provider, see the [summary by provider](#summary-by-provider) tabs. To find your column in the tables:

* **Claude subscription**: you sign in with a claude.ai account on the Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan
* **Anthropic Console**: you authenticate with an Anthropic API key
* **Amazon Bedrock**: you use Claude models from the Bedrock model catalog and set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`. The [Mantle endpoint](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock#use-the-mantle-endpoint) (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_MANTLE`) is covered by this column
* **Claude Platform on AWS**: you bought Claude through AWS Marketplace but call the Anthropic API, and set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_ANTHROPIC_AWS`
* **Google Vertex AI**: Google-operated; you set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`
* **Microsoft Foundry**: Anthropic-operated on Azure; you set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY`

### [​](#features-available-on-every-provider) Features available on every provider

These work identically on every provider:

* [CLI](/docs/en/quickstart) and [Agent SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview)
* [VS Code](/docs/en/vs-code) and [JetBrains](/docs/en/jetbrains) extensions
* [Subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents), [hooks](/docs/en/hooks-guide), [commands](/docs/en/commands), and [skills](/docs/en/skills)
* [CLAUDE.md memory](/docs/en/memory), [plugins](/docs/en/plugins), and [MCP servers](/docs/en/mcp)
* [Checkpoints](/docs/en/checkpointing), [sandboxing](/docs/en/sandboxing), and [Workflows](/docs/en/workflows)
* [OpenTelemetry metrics](/docs/en/monitoring-usage) and the [managed settings file](/docs/en/settings#settings-files)

### [​](#features-that-require-a-claude-subscription) Features that require a Claude subscription

These require signing in with a claude.ai account and are not reachable with an Anthropic Console API key or from a third-party provider:

* [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web), Claude Code on mobile, and [Claude Code in Slack](/docs/en/slack)
* [Claude Code Desktop](/docs/en/desktop)
* [Routines](/docs/en/routines) (`/schedule`)
* [Ultraplan](/docs/en/ultraplan) and [Ultrareview](/docs/en/ultrareview)
* [Code Review](/docs/en/code-review): Team and Enterprise plans
* [Remote Control](/docs/en/remote-control)
* [Chrome extension](/docs/en/chrome)
* [Computer use](/docs/en/computer-use): Pro and Max plans
* [Artifacts](/docs/en/artifacts): Team and Enterprise plans
* [Voice dictation](/docs/en/voice-dictation)

Desktop is the partial exception: Enterprise deployments can route Desktop to Vertex AI or a gateway provider via [managed settings](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12622667-enterprise-configuration), and the [Cowork on 3P research preview](https://claude.com/docs/cowork/3p/overview) runs the Code tab on Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry, or a self-hosted LLM gateway. For per-plan availability of these features, see [Availability by subscription plan](#availability-by-subscription-plan).

### [​](#cli-capabilities-that-vary-by-provider) CLI capabilities that vary by provider

These features work in the local CLI but depend on a server-side capability that not every provider exposes.

| Feature | Claude subscription | Anthropic Console | Amazon Bedrock | Claude Platform on AWS | Google Vertex AI | Microsoft Foundry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Web search](/docs/en/tools-reference#websearch-tool-behavior) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | See note [1](#fn1) | ✓ |
| [Fast mode](/docs/en/fast-mode) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Auto mode](/docs/en/auto-mode-config) | ✓ | ✓ | See note [2](#fn2) | ✓ | See note [2](#fn2) | See note [2](#fn2) |
| [Advisor](/docs/en/advisor) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Channels](/docs/en/channels) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [`/loop` scheduled tasks](/docs/en/scheduled-tasks) | ✓ | ✓ | See note [3](#fn3) | ✓ | See note [3](#fn3) | See note [3](#fn3) |
| [GitHub Actions](/docs/en/github-actions) and [GitLab CI/CD](/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

### [​](#admin-and-analytics) Admin and analytics

Organization-level controls and usage visibility.

| Feature | Claude subscription | Anthropic Console | Amazon Bedrock | Claude Platform on AWS | Google Vertex AI | Microsoft Foundry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Analytics dashboard and API](/docs/en/analytics) | ✓ (Team and Enterprise) | ✓ [5](#fn5) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Server-managed settings](/docs/en/server-managed-settings) | ✓ (Team and Enterprise) | ✓ (Team and Enterprise) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Zero Data Retention](/docs/en/zero-data-retention) | ✓ (qualified Enterprise accounts) | ✓ (qualified accounts) | See note [4](#fn4) | ✓ (qualified accounts) | See note [4](#fn4) | See note [4](#fn4) |

1 On Vertex AI, web search is available for Claude 4 models and later.  
2 Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE`. See [Auto mode configuration](/docs/en/auto-mode-config).  
3 Explicit intervals such as `/loop every 2 hours` work on every provider. On Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Foundry, `/loop` cannot pick its own interval or supply the default maintenance prompt, so a prompt with no interval runs every 10 minutes, and `/loop` with no arguments shows the usage message. See [Scheduled tasks](/docs/en/scheduled-tasks).  
4 Subject to your agreement with the cloud provider.  
5 Dashboard and API only. [Contribution metrics](/docs/en/analytics#enable-contribution-metrics) requires a claude.ai Team or Enterprise organization.

If you authenticate through an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway), feature availability matches the underlying provider the gateway forwards to. Some Anthropic-only features such as the [Advisor](/docs/en/advisor) work only if the gateway forwards requests intact to the Anthropic API.

### [​](#summary-by-provider) Summary by provider

Each tab lists what is unavailable or partially supported on that provider, with alternatives where one exists. Everything not listed works the same as on a Claude subscription. On Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry, and Claude Platform on AWS, error reporting and telemetry to Anthropic are off by default. See [default behaviors by API provider](/docs/en/data-usage#default-behaviors-by-api-provider) for what traffic still reaches Anthropic and how to opt out.

* Amazon Bedrock
* Claude Platform on AWS
* Google Vertex AI
* Microsoft Foundry
* Anthropic Console

## [​](#availability-by-subscription-plan) Availability by subscription plan

If you authenticate through Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry, or an Anthropic Console API key, this section does not apply to you. When you sign in with a claude.ai account, your plan determines which of the features below are available.

6 On Enterprise, requires a premium seat or a Chat + Claude Code seat. See [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web).  
7 Not included in the standard Enterprise plan. Requires separate enablement by Anthropic for qualified accounts. See [Zero Data Retention](/docs/en/zero-data-retention).
For pricing and the full plan comparison, see [Team plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9266767-what-is-the-team-plan) and [Enterprise plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9797531-what-is-the-enterprise-plan).

## [​](#model-availability) Model availability

For which Claude models and context-window sizes are available per provider and region, see [Model configuration](/docs/en/model-config) and the [Models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). Vision, PDF input, and extended thinking are model capabilities rather than Claude Code features and work on every provider that offers the model. [Prompt caching](/docs/en/prompt-caching) works the same way on most providers; on Bedrock, support varies by model.
